Bobbi told me this. Claire, wait, you watch 30 seconds to concentrate. 10, 70 and 8. Great. Claire, it's up to you. So, them, it makes sense. You always say you started your life coming from Vagram. You are in the 17th arrondissement. Then you live with your mother Rudobini in the 17th district. And now, you live near the place that chiste, to say a poorer neighborhood, in the 17th arrondissement, a biseurde. We can say so, since he will be dead at the moment of his remarks. So we can give your address. So, I would like to know, first of all, was your family what we call a bourgeoisie family, a bourgeoisie family of rights, you know what? I always say, I always say, I've lived when I'm asked. Because it is true that it is a fall. I started from the top of the 17th. Very boudix 17th. And then, in my childhood, I experienced the crisis before the war, that, I have memories before the crisis, I was not tall, but one of the memories was the name of an empty apartment. You were gambling with way more money, and there were rented apartments everywhere, everywhere. So my parents had to approach the beautiful apartment at the top of the 17th, near the Ac de Triomphe. And then he coated himself, it was still not bad. It was not far from Voulot-Valzerbe, a small street, the Rédo-Bini. And then, when I'm back from the Pairie, et toi, grand, the extrefrontière of the 17th, but it's the 17th sonic part, a bit prolo, the rue Nallel, the rue all that, and not far, the house was Verlaine, who was by Hiche. So it's a fall, in a few years, I don't know where I am anyway, but it's not going to get better, all that. It's you ? Yes, to that, you. But my family, my family, was a heuist family, a middle-class family, on the right, no, because where on the right, yes, it's certainly not on the left. You have to put the situation in order, but open up to children, I don't have many. I don't have many, because even memory fades away, it's more of a faculty that should push back the past than the wound. Memory, it takes a lot of memory to push back the past, precisely. It's not archive. So, I have this memory, there were even fittings, where there were fittings with flat on the ouet, all that. The crisis, I experienced a lot. What year was I? Ah, this day, I tell you my years, it's not between 30 and 35, that 30, I do more. Finally... What was I 10 years old? People had more money, I was born in 25, yes. So, but I remember, and he cared about money. That's what saved me from going to J-8. I put down. That's not more money to me. I was decided at D-8 and then I was in high school. Because there was the crisis. But the other aspect is more, there was another aspect of the crisis that I remember. It's more, there is another aspect, but not very close. And then there is war. He won then my father, yes. It was a family indeed. When there is a family on the right, yes. Because... That, I observed very keenly. They didn't come back. That's why I understand the bosses better, some bosses now. The terror they kept from the popular front, which is something unbelievable, the cross. Popular front, it is... Even without doubt, perhaps bosses who did not live. But then they must remain still who have not lived. It's... For them, it's the Stébénibace of the Pyrg-68 tile, the popular front. And I observed someone, all this right-wing bourgeoisie, saw the symptom of an anti-Sébyte iso, all of them, and... and Blou, it's some sound of... Defending hatred. If you want hatred, that... Invite me France. Had on the back, but is nothing. Nothing nothing. On the hate side, which Blou will pick up, because Blou was really the first. Paid vacation was... Faring the reaction paid vacation. The first leftist Jews. Ah... Blou, that was... Yes, that's you... That's your... I don't know, worse than the devil, that's your sign. We don't understand how Pétain could have... could take power. There is burden if we do not see the level of antice and pithism of France at that time, of the French bourgeoisie at that time, the hatred of the social measures of the Blou government, that was. .. it was the farant. When my father, he was a bit on fire. Yes. There, there. Good, but it's very common for you at this deproc. There, in the fact of the right familiar, a cult, there is a cultivated bourgeoisie. So. Me, it was quite a cult bourgeoisie. Complete a cult. But my father, she was I believe, on fishing. No, but he was an exquisite man. He was very careful, very good, very charming. And me, it seemed quite surprising. It's this violence against... They came from the war of 14. It's a world that we understand very well on the whole, but we can't imagine the detail. It's old from the war of 14. At the same time, the antiseritism, the regime of the crisis, what was this crisis that nobody understood anything. Finally, there it is. He was on the job. He was at Géliore. He was very, very special at Géliore. I saved two glue activities. He was... Did he invent at Le Pâne or did he use the watertight roofs to produce cider à rang? The tangeities of the roofs. But with the crisis, there was only one worker left in N'italia. So, in addition, a strange thing, it all worked very badly. And then the case fell apart. He relocated to a more serious industry that made balloons, trics, airships, arm pipes. But at one point, it was absolutely useless. At point 19, he had some in high family to stop the German planes. I know why, but it really was like carrier pigeons. While we get out of the factory where at work is mounted, they have been more resolvable, they have converted everything into the manufacture of pneumatic gifts. pneumatic gifts, it was more efficient. And they didn't make balloons and eplanes. And me, I saw this descent of the war. I saw that, I have a great sigh to say, I didn't like you. In any case I was 14 years old, the way people knew very well that they had gained a year, that with Munich, that they knew gained a year, a few months, when they were the war. Well, it was linked, the crisis, the war, all that. It was maybe less, it was a very tense adventure. I did not forget a little bigger. Live members at expense. Bit bin 11. One second. Yes, whenever you want. When the Germans really arrived, we passed Belgium, descended on France, all that. Me, I was in d'auville because it was the place where my parents spent the holidays. Always the holidays were. And we were them, they had already returned. They left us what was unimaginable. We had a mother who never left us. But the consère was in a boarding house. And gave us an old lady who owed a pension. And I did a year of schooling at d'auville, in a hotel that had become a high school. The Germans weren't long. Ah well no, I cruffons everything. It was during a phoney war. Yes. I was in high school at d'auville, it had always been, when I was talking earlier about paid holidays, I don't remember all the more that the arrival of the first paid holidays on the beach of d'auville, she was something for a man of the cinema. It should be a masterpiece. Because when you see, it's like seeing the hand for the first time. It is prodigious. Me, I saw someone who saw for the first time in his life. The mother much later. It's splendid. She was a little girl from the Limousin who had been with us and who had seen the mother for the first time. It's true that it's something unimaginable when you haven't seen it, it's the mother. We can say before the mother. It's something grand, something finished, but we don't put anything on it. But when you see the mother and this young girl remained, I don't know four bags in front of the mother, completely stupefied as if she were an obedience idiot. And she doesn't have it, it's not in front of such a sublime, such a grand spectacle. Well, then, that implies opinion. Which was a flage reserved for people for a long time. Luckily, it was their property. Really, paid holidays and people who are us, you had never seen the mother. And it was grand. If class hatred is anything, it's words like elase. My mother, who was nevertheless the best of women, said, I am able to frequent a flage where there were people like that. So it was very hard. They never, me, I think, the bourgeois they never forgot. But 60 then, you have nothing to say. The meals, the fear they had that you were going to voice later. Fear, like you're not there to be. From now on. If we have holidays for the workers, it was all the bourgeois privileges that disappeared. And the places, there too, are preliminary questions. If the good ones did everything. Good, on the pressure vessels at the beach of our cities. It was, I don't know, all of a sudden, it was the dinosaur's turn. I don't know, it was an assault. It was worse than the Germans. It was worse than the calming times coming on the beach. In France, it was indisputable. It was an opium people. Especially since it's a detail. But what was happening in the factories, not really. They never forgot that. They were still, they were scared and repeated. I don't want to say that 68, the inviinities, 68, it was something else. But they didn't lose, so no more worries, only 68. Anyway, I was in our towns, without parents, with my brother, all that. That the Germans really broke it. So yes, that's where I know, it's trials. I mean, I was a young boy. It would be very mediocre, hoarsely, of interest to only an interest to believe that it is. I was, I believe, collecting stamps. It was my highest activity. And then I came, the class. And I had what happened to a lot of people. I think we're still... I don't know the people who are awake at my hand. They are always woken up by someone. And me, there was, in this hotel, there was a young guy who will seem extraordinary, because he spoke very well. And that was the absolute wake-up call for me. It was lucky to fall on a guy. In this type it was then relatively well-known. First of all, he had a father, a little famous. And then he did a lot of activities in the warp. But much later it was called Hanvax. It was Pierre Hanvax, the son of the sociologist. He was his very young one. And he had a headache. He was very thin, very tall, a little tall. I believe in my memory. He only had one eye. Meaning, he had one eye open and the other closed. Not by nature, but he stood like that. He was a bit of a Cyclops. He had a goat that wanted to curl very much like a goat. Yes, more than like a sheep. And he owed to the cold, he owed to or via the fact. He was in extremely fragile health. It's good that he was reformed. And he tele-sensed, and that we had put teachers there, during the war, to fill the... And that was a revelation for me. So he was hovering in 12th. I know much more in some of these. I am during 4th and good in 3rd. And he communicated to us. Finally, he communicated to me something that... It was good, verse that we can see. I discovered something. He spoke to us about the skin of the air and he read us very well. And we bonded. It's good, not if he saw well, that he impressed me enormously. And I remember there is a level. So on the beach at d'Oville, he puts some on me. I remember, I stuck it to the letter. I was his disciple, I have you. I will find a master. And we sat on the dunes. And there, in the wind, the sea, all that, this theme. Sometimes he read to me. So I remember. He read me earthly foods. There is a person on a beach in winter. He cried earthly food to her. I was also next to him. I was a little frozen if someone arrived. He had, I thought, it's weird, all that. He read to me, it was very varied. He makes me discover an atolle France, Baudelaire, Gide, I believe that this goodness, the main ones, are great loves. It's great love. But I was transformed, absolutely transformed. So that it got people talking pretty quickly, this guy with the lure who had it, this big scale, and all that, this range he followed everywhere, they went on the beach together, all that. And me, at the game, it is very quickly worried. He made me come. She said that she was responsible for me, in the absence of my parents, that she warned me about certain relationships. I did not understand anything. I did not understand anything. If the place of pure, questionable and avoible relations, it was indeed that one. And I understood it only afterwards, it was assumed that Pirel Vax was in the BD-RASSE game. So I tell him, I'm annoyed. I obviously saw you, he's killing me, you're yais, I said, I said, I said you mustn't see that all that isn't normal, it's not comfortable. And he tells me, listen, don't worry, no lady, no old lady can resist me, who says, I'm going to explain to her, I'm going to go see her, it will be very reassuring. And me, I was just to those clever ones, he had given me back, it's really there for me to have my doubts. I was not at all calm by that, because I had a pressing y bank. It was not at all sure that the old landlady, and indeed, it was a disaster. He had gone to see the old landlady, who immediately had to write my parents, that it sharpened you Urgen, they made me come back, that it made you an extremely suspicious individual, so he had completely missed his shot. But there are really the Germans when they arrive, yes, all that was the big war, the Germans arrive more for their own good. And my brother, we went by bike to find my parents who were taken to Rochefort. The factory moved to Rochefort, that is to say to escape the Germans. So we did that by bike. I remember seeing the speech of the state again, the famous infamous speech, in a village obege, all that, then we put on Téa Vélo. And a crossroads on which fell a car, the computer of the cartoons, where he had the old alvax, the son alvax, a beautician who was called Bayer, at the time. And they went not far from La Rochefort. It was a fate. Alright, all of that. But then, I recount the sequence to say that with a loan, I found alvax. I knew him, I knew him well. I had more admiration for him. It's true that good. But it taught me at least something. That's me, when I was 14, 13, 14. And it was when I admired him that I was right. I have coil twelve. So you're going back to Paris? We'll hear you in Paris. Then, you return to Paris with some difficulty. We read his carnals, since the maquants are finished, there, in the Two Wars. And there, we read his carnals. You're doing your philosophy classes. I think in high school at that time, there was Marlowe Ponti, who was a teacher. But you, strangely, you are in the class of a teacher who is not Marlowe Ponti, you are with the other teacher who is called Monsieur Vial. It seems to me that you told me that name. Yes, Mr Vial. Yes, yes, there, I kept it, I tell you, very, very overwhelmed. But there, it was a coincidence. I was distributed. So I could have tried going to Berlowe Ponti. I have not done. I do not know why. But Vial was... That happened to him a maximum effect with a path something of what was the literature. But from the first philosophy classes, I knew that's what I would do. That... I remember scattered things like that. For example, I remember very well. I was in philosophy when we learned about very powdery comics. We love it. We love it, it wasn't safe. There was a kind of... It must be said that I was in the class, it must have been a class that was a little... politicized, a little sensitive to questions, an Asia, etc. I was in Guy-Banquet's class, I remember. And there was a funny atmosphere in this class. In any case, it's a year of rador. It was something hitting and boys of 17. I don't know who at age did. His bachouge no longer knows. 17 18, no, 17 years old. It says 17 years. 18 years old, there, normal. I remember very well. So Vial was a teacher. He spoke very low. He was old, and I liked him very much. He doesn't know me. So, from Berloponti, I weld him with melancholy. Because no, it's a big high school where there is a balustrade that goes all the way to the first floor. And there was a very melancholy gaze from Berloponti who watched all the scales below, who played, who screamed, a great melancholy. It's emblisse, I say, what the hell am I doing here. As long as you say Vial, there, let me expand, he made that career, and there too, I had a lot of ties with him. Very very related. As we live not far away, we don't tell each other diamonds. We don't talk about it. And there, I knew that either I would do philosophy or nothing. And from the first shots. Yes Yes Yes. Yes, it's as if you want, when I learned of the existence, there were things as strange as what we called concepts, it had the same effect on me as for others, the meeting a character from a fantasy novel. God I was put off, for example. The account of Monte Christophe. Monsieur Charles Luss, a great character in a novel, where wallows one or anything, where I said grandet. When I learned, I don't know myself, even things like, what Plato called an idea, it seemed so alive to me. Also lively too, I knew it feels like you, feels like you to me, feels like it to me. And you were immediately very good, the best? Yes yes. There, I had taken the school problem. Since Alvarque, I was good. Since then, I was good, I was good, even in Latin, even in... Yes, I was good. I was a bordelève, and in philosophy, I became a very bordelève. And I would like us to come back a little bit too. She was not at all politicizing the classes at that time. You say, something a little special was happening in the fact that class, since there were things guillemoké... To politicize, it couldn't have been the war. He was not politicized. There were surely boys who turned 17, 18, were resisting. And those weren't conditions. The people who made resistance existed with less crests. So, we can't talk about politicization or not. There were indifferent people, parties in d'wichy, and there were... An awakening French action? And no, no, a French action. It has you much worse, it has you bichy, or, it has you... So we can say... No, it has no comparison with politicization in so much peace. Then on the active elements, really, it was resistance, young resistance fighters, or young people in relation to resistance. So it had nothing to do with politicization. It was much more secret, much more... For example, in your class, there were people who were sympathizers, young people, who were already sympathizers with the resistance, and who spoke. Yes, I'm quoting you, said, monquin, who had died, I believe, who was associated with the Nazis... a year later, I believe. But do you talk about it? Oh, of course, yes. Just as I tell you, the mediate noise, communication and the mediate of Radour, it was the theme communication, it was the theme, you are an essay, it was the theme. It became known, I believe, the same day, that we were going from here, via lesia, no, known. That's for me, there are things that are more moving, learn it, afterwards, learn, Radour, as if immediately. So, to put an end to childhood, if we never end it, precisely, your child, it seems to have little importance for you, that is to say that neither everything speaks , nor is it a reference, we do not have the impression of a great importance of childhood. Yes Yes Yes. Doing your hands, okay, it's almost a bit of a function of everything we've just said. I really consider that the activity of creations cannot be said to have anything to do with its own business. Not at all that one does not put all his soul into it. Literature, in depth, scriptures have fundamentally to do with life. But life is more than personal. Everything that doesn't matter in literature, something from the person's life, from the writer's personal life, is by nature angry... You naturally have it, since it prevents him from seeing, that preventing him from you is there, that won't have him, surely, his little private affair. It was never that, me, my childhood. It's not that my way time. What would bring me, if need be, is just as we said, there are become ransimals that their hand goes opp, there are become rannimals, and writing, I believe, is always becoming thing. That's why we don't write to write, so no more. I believe that one writes because something of life passes through you. Whatever it is, there are things that... We write for life, that's it. And we become something. To write is to become. But it's becoming anything you want, except becoming a writer. And it's doing everything you want, except the archive. So as much as I respect the archive. There it's good because we do archives, but it's not... it's of interest, only in relation to something else. Compared to something else, if there is reason to make archives, it is precisely because there is something else. And that through the archive, we will perhaps grasp that there is something of this other thing. But the very idea, for example, of talking about my childhood, seems like a thought because me, because it has no interest. But that's because it's the opposite of all the hiterature. It is contrary. You are purely... Me, I read a... I've read that a thousand times already, what I'm saying everyone has said it, all the writers have always said it. But I come across a book, I know it, I don't know, everyone knows too much, a close friend, mandel-stame. So I read yesterday, precisely, as I said to myself... There is a very beautiful first name, can you read the comment? Also, yes, also, no. He says in this sentence, it's equivalences, it's a type of brake, it bowled me over, it's a type of brake. And that's what. The role of a teacher, that's it, it's communicated, a text, done, well, a text, a degamin, that's what it does for me. Good, good. He says to him, there's something I don't understand, I don't know exactly, it's writers, I've never been able to understand people like Tolstoyle, even Tolstoyle. Lovers of family archives with their epics of household souvenirs. This is where it starts to get serious. I repeat, my memory has no love but hostility. And she works not to reproduce, but to record the past for an intellectual of mediocre origin, like him. Memory is useless. He just has to talk about the books he has read and his biography is done. Like me, with Alvaq, that fat guy. There, at the dear of happy generations, the popes by their exams and in chronicles, at home, is thus held in a gap. And between me, there is an abyss, a skew filled with noisy time. What did my family mean? I do not know. She has been ring of descent and forgives herself with something to say. On me, on many of my contemporaries, weighs the stuttering of birth. We learned not to speak, but to busier evil. And they are decomposed to go to the increasing noises of the century and once whitened by the listening of its crest that we have acquired a language. I don't know about that, that really means. To write was to drink from life. It was boigner for life. It was to work on their thumb, in the sense in which they said it, for the beasts that will have me. It's babble in the language. Doing literature, appealing to childhood, is doing the typical, literature is a small private affair. It's disgust. It's the beasts, it's the real shit. If we don't push him to this point, where he yawns, because it's not easy, it's not enough to bathe like that. If we don't go that far, maybe it's in the literature, just like afford to push the engage to a limit. There is an animal becoming of language itself and of writing. There is also a becoming child, he becomes a child, yes, but it is not his child. That, the most childhood of anyone. He is the child of the world, he is the child of a world. So those who are interested in childhood, they will make themselves, and then they continue, they make the literature that deserves. If someone does not know how to interest in his child, it is Proust, for example. Well, the writer's floor isn't delved into the family archives. It's not taking an interest in one's child, that, no one is anyone to take an interest in, no one worthy, worthy of the cross whatsoever to take an interest in one's child. It's another page of becoming a child, through writing, arriving at a childhood of the world, restoring a childhood of the world. That's what that is, that's a level, that's a level of literature. The child does not care. The child beats, there is another company knew it, that considered from his mother, everything is known all the writers knew it. She doesn't need it. It has become, yes, my jale, if I can't manage to find another formula than that, and writing has become well, but it has become neither writing, nor its own memory, nor this whole that, no. And it's not because I had a love affair that I'm going to do it again. But it's filthy, think of it like that, it's not just media, it's filthy. So an exception to the rule is that Natalisa Roed, who is an animator, is a writer writing an alive called “In France”, she has a little weakness. But not at all, at all. There I am very late in opinion, Natalisa Roed is animating, it is a writer. In France, it is the product of the book of his childhood. It would be typical, not a book, testified. And I've played the voque before. You are well understood that you played the vôque at the range, but it's a very dangerous role and you don't understand that. Is it a real gender? She invents a childhood of the world. What interested on my childhood, Natalisa my pipe? It's a certain number of tirotipated formulas from which she will work wonders. It could just as well be what she did with... Is that the second era? The last words, or whose last words again? From Chekov. Chekov's last words. She's going to shoot in front... She's going to shoot from... Ah, little girl, someone's been saying for a long time, how are you? So what is it how are you? How is she ? She's going to get my language out of it. It will cause language to proliferate on itself. You're still talking about all that. Interested in her childhood, Natalisa Rote. But me, I don't mind all that, but all the same... The other one Rote, you would respect his childhood very much. It's what ? It's a matter of the soul. Yes what is it ? But me, I want all that, but at the same time, first of all, it's a training from the first hour that pushed you towards literature. That is to say, you repressed your childhood. You repelled him as an enemy and as hostile. First, from what age, is it training? And on the other hand, childhood comes back well by puffing, even if it's puffs, drippings. That is to say, childhood. So, is it necessary to have an almost daily training or a daily discipline? That's all of it, I guess. Because childhood, childhood, childhood. It's like everything, it would be necessary to distinguish a mafesse in France. It's a good childhood. I call, what's interesting? Good, report with the father the mother and the memories of childhood or sense of heart, one can go my mother. Doesn't sound very interesting. It does not seem interesting and very rich for itself. It really doesn't seem like a very expensive piece of writing. There are other aspects of childhood. I was aiming earlier, achemalme, in the argue, before the cars. It rediscovered the emotion of children. He's a child. So. It would be necessary to say the child that I was, it is nothing. But I'm not just the child I was. I was a child among others. I was an ordinary child. And it's always a title of some kid that I saw that was interesting. It's not under, I head such a child. I saw a choice to die on the street before there were automobiles. I'm not talking too less, but for those who have seen it. Well yes, it worked very well, very well, perfect. Perfect, it's a task to become a writer. Perhaps a factor which made that, of Otsoïevski, the avu, there is a large page of Otsoïevski. I believe in writing my chatters on the path that loses itself in the street. Nijinsky, the dancer, the view, Nijitslava. He's seen chatter before. When he has viaturage, I believe. I'm opening it like this. Well, it's going very well. And you, have you seen the demonstrations of the popular front? Me, I saw the demonstrations of the popular front. Yes, I saw my father struggle between his annoyance, his anti-Semitism. So. I was a child. I have always called ie on the meaning that includes not the meaning of the indefinite article. From a child and beaten, axe, badly and whipped, etc. It doesn't mean me, it means. The indefinite article is the edoriche is extrehensible. It's all the multiplicities. We come back. It is multiplicity.
