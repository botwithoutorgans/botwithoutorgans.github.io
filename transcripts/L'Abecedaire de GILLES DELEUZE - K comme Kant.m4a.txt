So what about those cantes of all the egg girls that you've done a study, when one seems farther from your own thought, yet you say that all the authors that you'll study have something in common. First, is there something in common between this cant and this pinoza? Which is not obvious. I prefer if jose the first part of the question. That is to say, why are you occupied with the cant of a cold one? There is nothing in common between cant and this pinoza. There is nothing in common between pinoza and pinoza. There is nothing in common between pinoza and pinoza. But it is not the same conception of philosophy. Why am I still fascinated by Kant? For reason, there is so much turning Kant. For a reason, it's a reason where he has a story-pouch until the end of something that has not been pushed into philosophy until then. Namely, it is rich from the courts. He is wealthy from the courts, he no doubt may have under French reflection. And until now, we always talk about concepts that the I tried to talk about concepts as characters. Before Kant, there is in the 18th century, after it is from Kant, there is a type of new philosopher who presents himself as the investigator. Investigation. Survey of human understanding. Investigate this. Investigate this. Philosophy has a bit like an investigator. Before again. Still in the 17th century, for example, the Eme Nitz is undoubtedly the last exhibitor of this trend. He sees himself as a lawyer. He defends a cause. And the most beautiful century in Eme Nitz claims to be the advocate of God. It is necessary to believe that God has things to reproach him at the time. And he writes to Mervilleuse at Puscus, the cause of God, which does not mean that God is a cause in the sense of God. The legal cause of God, the cause of God defended, etc. So it's like an intermingling of characters, the lawyer. The investigator is when a court arrives. A court of reason. Things are judged according to a court of reason. And the lot faculties of understanding, imagination, knowledge, morality, are measured according to a court of reason. Who makes use of a certain method, which is a prodigious method and which will call us the critical method. And which is the actual cant method. So this whole aspect is almost a little horror. Which is to say such a fascinated horror, because it's so awesome. If I go back to the question, among the concepts that when we are ahead, there is that of the court of reason, which is quite similar to the critical method. But anyway, I rather dream of... It's a court of judgment, it's the system of judgment. It's just that the judgment system needs God more. A system of judgment based on reason, and no longer on God. Me, all the authors who touch me, we have not limited this problem, but we can put it now, it will prevent us from coming back, it will make us... It will perhaps avoid us, we can always ask ourselves, because there is a mystery. But why is someone, someone in particular, you or me, we are linked or we recognize ourselves in one type of problem, and not in another. What's the end of someone with some kind of problem? These are not the mysteries of thought, and the greatest. We are dedicated to one of the problems, we don't push the import of which problem, that also goes for scholars, in science. Someone's end for such and such a problem, but such and such another problem, and he didn't enter into it. And a philosophy is a set of problems, generally, there is a specific consistency, which does not have to cover all the problems, god be hearing. Well, I feel a little connected to the problem, which proposes to look for means to put an end to the system of the judge. And to put something else in their place. So that, in the big names of that, that's one of the facts, that's another tradition, there, you were right to say that, that arises. I see this pilonza, I see Nietzsche, I see Lawrence literature, and in fact, I look to make it the newest and greatest, Arton. To finish, ecologically, of God, that means something, it's not a crazy word. It is really to be taken literally to put an end to the judgment system. So all that, these are things that would have meant that I wouldn't have had so much, only there you go, on that, it's as always, when we say that we must always look under the concepts for the problems. And on top of that, there are astonishing problems of Kant, which are marvels, and which are marvels. First, he is the first to have made an astonishing reversal of concept. There too, that's why it makes me slash so introspectively, when people are even at the baccalaureate level, when young people are taught a philosophy of abstraction without trying, even maybe it's not possible to make them participate in problems, which are fantastic problems, all the same, otherwise interesting. I do not know what. I can say up to Kant, for example. Time derived from motion. He was second to the movement. It was considered a number of movement, a measure of movement. What does Kant do? He can't bring how he does it? A concept is created. So, we don't know all that, including everything I'm saying, there's only that. We do not know to advance in what will come to create a concept. It reverses subordination with it, it is movement that depends on time. And suddenly, time changes its nature. It has to be circular, when time is subordinated to movement, for reasons that would be too long, finally, the great movement is periodic movement, it is the movement of rotation of the stars, it is the periodic motion of the stars. So the motion is circular. On the contrary, when time frees itself from movement, and it is movement that depends on time, then time becomes a straight line. And I always think of the word borgès, that one can choose it with Kant, when one is going to say of it a labyrinth more terrible than any circular labyrinth, a labyrinth in a straight line. That's a marvel, but it's Kant. It is he who frees up time to review. And then, try to pay tribute, there, which measures the role of each faculty according to such a goal. This is what happens at the end of his life, since he is one of the few, to have written very, very, very old to a book, where he renewed everything. Criticism of judgment. He arrives at the idea that it is necessary that the faculties help relate to disorder with each other. Which sister is grateful to you, reads all that, but which is a battle of the faculties which is out of proportion. He is no longer justice of a tribunal. This will be his theory of the sublime, his conception of the sublime, where the faculties enter into discordances, into discordant harmonies. So, that called me to finish. These discordant chords, this abira, which is more than a straight line, are reversals of the relationship. I can say, the whole Bendaire philosophy stemmed from that, that it was more time that depended on movement, but that movement depended on time. It's fantastic concept creations and the whole conception of the sublime, with the discordant agreements between the faculties, it touched me at the same time. So, what to say, it was obvious, he was a very, very great philosopher. And there is a whole base in him, which excites me, and what is built on it, even to say, there is, even to say, but that's fine. It is a judgment system that I would like to end with. But I am not. And the life of Kant. Oh, Kant's life. He did not see the denuitations without a sitting. That wasn't planned, huh? THANKS. 10 y. So, there was another aspect that could also have been pleasing in Kant. This is the aspect that wins Thomas de Kuinces, that is to say this fantastic life regulated by habits, a short walk, the life of a philosopher, such as one can imagine in a vision of criminal, finally, something very special, and which we think of when we think of you. That is to say, something fairly settled. The habit is huge. Me, I think that... Yes, I'm getting dressed as you mean, because Kuinces's text is enthusiasm, and me, is enthusiasm too, it's a chédeu, okay. And... It's true that it belongs to all philosophers. So they don't have the same habits, but whether they're creatures of habit, so it seems to say that they don't know and it's... It's forcex, they're creatures of habit. Because the spinosa, I don't have the impression that the spinosa, he also had a lot... Unexpectedly, he had a city with his lenses, police and his lenses, the supposed for him is the West Indies, he received visits like that, good. But you are neither his life in the position of the roads? It's not a glass that seems very agitated, except by the political remonstrances of the time, but when also, with political remonstrances in time, then, and then, all that is said, on the clothing apparatuses of Kant, it's going to help you with the machines to go up, I don't know what, in which direction, or on these bars, it'll all be fine, extremely, it'll still be fine, very, very charming, that is say needs. But all the philosophers, that's a bit what it says, the philosophers, they are generally chaste, poor, all that, and to add it. Only, try to become what good is it to them? What is this hunt for thelorcere, what is this povertylorcere, etc. When the world had its little daily walk, but it's nothing, what happens to the little daily walk? What is watching? What... Oh, that, we should know. But in the end, that philosophers are beings of habit, I believe that habit is contemplated, it is the contemplation of something, it is habit, really habit in the true sense of the word. , it is contemplated. So, what was contemplating in these walks? What... We don't know, me my habits, if we face up and we kill, me my habits, yes, I have lots of habits, it's contemplations, sometimes it's things that only I see, that's it, a habit, really.
