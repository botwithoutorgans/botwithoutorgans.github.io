So R is R as resistance and not ration. As you said in a recent lecture at la fémise, philosophy creates concepts and as soon as we create, as you said in this lecture, we resist. So artists, filmmakers, musicians, mathematicians, philosophers, all these people resist. But resist what exactly? First we will take philosophy by case, it creates concepts, but science, it creates concepts, does it? No, these are standing questions because if we agree, if we agree to reserve the word concept for philosophy, we go to scientific notions, scientific ideas, they must be designated by another word. We don't say of an artist either who creates concepts, a shepherd, a musician creates by concepts, he creates something else so for science you have to be open to other words. But it looks like for example a savant and someone who creates functions. But we, I'm not saying that's the best word, it creates functions but functions are created as much. We take the creation of new functions, Einstein, Galois, the great mathematicians but not only the mathematicians, the biologists who create functions. Well, what are these sacred resistances, these resistances, all that? It's clearer for the arts because science is in a more disgusting position and a bit like the cinema, the grips of such a problem of program, of capital, all that the parres of resistance, but finally, the great savants, it is all the same also great resistance fighters. We think of Einstein, of many physicists, of many biologists today, that's obvious. It first resists the practices and views of current opinion, that is to say all areas of questioning to a pessil, they demand their, they really have the strength to demand their critmain. We won't age them, an important thing in premature conditions, all that, it's up to all how bouchiculeera not an artist, nobody on the right bouchicule, an artist. But I believe that all that is because the created has resisted itself, it is because I, I believe that I am going to tell you and there is another that I stuck his hand in, who will do me a lot in Stegard is that I believe that one of the motives of art and thought is a certain shame of being a man. I believe that the man who said it, the artist, the writer who said it most profoundly was primon les vies. He knew how to talk about his theonde of being a man and him, he did an extremely deep level since it is following his turn of the great exterminations, he will be with it, he says, yes, I have been liberated, what dominated was the shame of being a man. So, it's a phrase that's both very splendid, I believe very beautiful and then, perhaps, it's not abstract, it's very, very concrete, the shame of being a man. But she doesn't want to say, the nonsense in resolving, that doesn't mean, we are all, that, that, you don't know how to say, we are all, it's guilty, for example, we are all, it's in front of the Nazism. Prima au lévil, he says it admirably, he says, that doesn't mean that electable bullies are the same, that, we're not yet open to that. There are many people who tell us, yes, we are all guilty and no, no, nothing at all. We won't confuse the elavictim stuffer, that. So the shame of being a man doesn't mean we're all the same, we're all compromised, etc. But that means, I believe several things, it's a complex feeling, it's not a unified feeling. There, we are all as men, that means at the same time, how could men have done that, men, that is to say other than me. How could they do this? And secondly, how did I still make a deal, I didn't become a bully, but I still made a deal enough to survive. And then, a certain shame, precisely, to have survived in the place of certain friends who themselves are not surviving, all that. It is therefore an extremely composite feeling, the shame of being a man. Me, I believe that at the base of art, there is this idea that, where this very strong feeling, a certain shame of being a man who makes that art, its grossista, freed the life that the man imprisoned. Man does not stop imprisoning life, does not stop killing life. The shame of being a man, the artist is the one who releases a powerful life, a more than personal life. It's not his life. How do I get back to you on the artist and resistance? That is to say that this share of shame in being a man, art liberates, life in this prison, in this prison of shame, is very different from sublimation. Finally, the art is not at all, it is really a story. Oh no, it is. It's a release of life, it's a liberation, life. What is that ? And there, it is not at all abstract things. What's a great novel character? A great character from a novel is not a character borrowed from the real and even inflated. Charlu, it's not mounted what, it's not mounted what, even inflated by the brilliant imagination of proustes. It's fantastic life powers. It's fantastic life powers, so bad it turns out. A character from a novel, he has integrated into himself. Limbs, he's a kind of giant. It's an exaggeration in relation to life, but it's not an exaggeration in relation to art. There he is producing these exaggerations. And it is through their existence soil, it is already resistance. Or, as we said, we join our first theme, ah! Ecrique is always writing for animals. That is to say, not their intention, but in their place, it's that fresh animals aren't, it's going to rewrite, right? Liberate life. Liberating life is prisons that man... And that's resisting, that's resisting, it's not... We can see it with artists, I'll say it step by step. There is no art that is not a release of a power of life. There is no art of death first. There is no art, is not enough, after my advice, he ended up committing suicide. Alright, alright, so afterwards, he committed suicide personally. Yeah, he couldn't hold it. He committed suicide in his personal life. There are four pages or soft pages or no primolevial pages that remain in termin. It will remain in resistance and eternal. What happened, there is a trick. And so much more, I'm talking about the wonder of being a man. It's not even in the grand sense of the top of primolévies, you understand. Because if we don't dare say something like that, but each of us, in our daily life, there are tiny events that inspire us with the wonder of being a man. We are witnessing a scene where someone really is a little too vulgar. We're not going to make a scene. We are embarrassed. We are embarrassed for him. One is embarrassed for oneself, since one seems to me to support it, almost. There too, we make a kind of compromise. And if we protest by saying, but it's inéop, what you say, we violate a drama. We are trapped. We are, we are provelas. It can't be compared with Rojuit. But even at this tiny level, there's a little shame in being a man. If we do not prove this shame, there is no reason to make art. It's not long things. But when you crib certainly when you have an artist, you feel, it's danger, all the time. And danger that surrounds, there are dangers everywhere. Of course. Yes. In philosophy too, that's what Nutsch said, a philosophy that doesn't harm stupidity, doesn't harm stupidity, resists stupidity. But if there was no philosophy, it must be as if philosophy was pretious and good for conversations to apprehend. But if there was no philosophy, we would not suspect the level of stupidity. Philosophy prevents stupidity from being as great as it would be if there were no philosophy. It is its splendour. We do not wonder what it would be. Just as if there weren't the arts but the vulgarity of people. So when we say, it's resisting, it's resisting, it's actually, I mean, the world wouldn't be skilled, if there wasn't art. That, people, they would hold out longer. They don't have that they read philosophy, but it's its only existence that keeps people from being as stupid and stupid as they would be if it appears. And you, for example, when we announce the death of thought, you know that there are people who love the death of thought, the death of cinema, the death of literature. It's to make people laugh. There is no death, there are assassinations. It is very simple. Maybe we have assassinations in the cinema, that's possible. But there is no natural death. For a simple reason, until something holds up and takes over the function of philosophy, philosophy will have every right to exist. And if something else takes on the function of philosophy, I don't see anything growing out of it other than philosophy. If we say, for example, philosophy, it consists in creating concepts and thereby harming stupidity, preventing stupidity. Why do you want philosophy to die? We can prevent it, we can censor it, we can secure it. But it has a function. She's not going to die. My death from philosophy still doesn't give me an idea, but a stupid one, what an idiotic idea. It's a widower that I don't want to air. I'm very happy that she's not dying, but I even understand because that means the death of philosophy. It seems to me, it seemed to me a little stupid, how nice, to say something. To say things have changed, a few reasons. But what will replace philosophy? What will create concepts? So you can tell me we need to create more concepts. Oh yes, and stupidity rules. Fine, it's the idiots who... Well, they want the skin of philosophy, fine. But what will create concepts? It's the computer, it's the ads, they probably have a concept. Very well, well we will have the advertising concepts, it is the concept of a brand of noodles. It's not likely to cause much rivalry with philosophy, because I don't think the word concept is used in the same way. But today, it is rather advertising that presents itself as the direct rival of philosophy, then it is an oversight. We invent the concepts. But the concepts of computing, the concepts of computers, it's rather funny, what they call a concept. Yes, we don't have to do that again. Can we say that you, Felix Foucault, form networks of concepts like networks of resistance, like a war machine, against a dominant thought of commonplaces? It would be good, if it were true, it would be very good. In any case, the network is surely the only one... If we do it through schools, and schools, that doesn't seem very, very good to me, like once. If we don't want schools, there's only the system of networks, complicity,... Of course, that's always been like that, moreover, all the times. What is called romanticism, for example, what is called German romanticism or general romanticism, is a network, what is called Dadaism is a network, whereas there are networks today. I'm sure, yes. The resistance zone. By this very fact, the function of the network is to resist, yes, to be created, yes. And you, do you feel, for example, famous and clandestine, this notion of clandestinity, clandian? I don't insist, I don't smell famous. I do not feel clandestine, I would indeed like to be imperceptible. It was... But there are a lot of people who would like, who want to be imperceptible, they couldn't say that I wasn't. But being imperceptive is good because... We can... Yes, but those are questions, so almost personal, what I want, what I want is to do my job. It's that we don't fool around, that we don't waste time, yes. At the same time seeing people, because I need to, I'm like everyone else, I like people. Finally, I like a small number of people, I like to see them. But when I see them, I don't see that that makes hand in hand the problem, what, imperceptible relationships, imperceptible people, that's what has bigger people, what. I mean, we're all molecules, what, it's a network molecule to molecular network, what, yes. Is there a strategy of philosophy? For example, when you are writing about Aïbnitz this year, is it strategically that you are writing about Aïbnitz now? I guess it depends on a strategy, that means, we don't write in a certain necessity. If there is no need to make a book, that is to say no need felt by the one he is doing, well it is better that he not do it. So when I wrote about Aïbnitz, it's because for me it requires you. And why do you need it? Because you came for me, mummy, that would be explained to everyone, not by the teeth of the Aïbnitz, but of the fold. And that the fold, bah, it happened that for me, it has the fundamental missed at the Aïbnitz. But that, I could say of each book that we did, that we were the necessity at the time. No, but apart from the flu of necessity that pushes you to write, that is to say the return to a philosopher, like from the history of philosophy, after the book on cinema, where books like him plaitent or the whole said, is that in this land... There was no return to a philosopher, that's why I answered your question correctly. I didn't write a book on the Aïbnitz, I only wrote a book on the Aïbnitz, because for me the mum came to study what a trick is to you. I write the history of philosophy when I need to, that is to say, when I encounter, and prove in it, a notion which is itself already linked to a philosopher. When I became passionate about the notion of expression, I wrote a book on this pinoza, because this pinoza is a philosopher who has taken the notion of expression to an extremely high point. When I came across the notion of fold on my own, it seemed to me helpful either that it would be through the Aïbnitz, that the marie would have encountered notions that are not already dedicated to philosophy. I won't do the history of philosophy, but for me there is no difference between writing a history of philosophy book and writing a philosophy book. So it's a sense that I say I had my way.
