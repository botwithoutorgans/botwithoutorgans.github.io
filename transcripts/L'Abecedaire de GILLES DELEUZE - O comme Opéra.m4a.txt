So, high is opera. Opera, we have just learned, is to rebel a little. It was a bit of a joke, because, apart from Voïttièc and Loulou de Berge, we can say that opera is not entirely in your business or in your interests. It's something, you can talk about the exception made for Berge, but unlike Foucault or Châtelet, who is but very much the Pérait-Aliens, you've never listened to much music or particularly Péra. You see what would interest you more, it's the popular song. The popular song is particularly edited-piaf. You have a passion for edite-piaf. And I would like you to seize a little. No, it's good, you're a little sovereign there. First of all, I was able to listen to a lot of music there, bah bah. A long time ago. And then, I try because I told you, it's not possible. It's not possible. It's a taste, it's to be there, it's too much time. It takes too much time. You have to have time. I do not have the time. I still have a lot to do. I'm not talking about doing, not gourmet, there. No social gourmet. I want to make creations or things. I don't have time to listen to music, or not enough time to listen to it. Good. For example, each bed worked, we listen to opera. Yes, yes, that, that, it's an amette. I couldn't have that. He was listening to opera. Yes. But I don't know if he did it when he was working maybe. When he dresses people, that I understand. Me, it covered, we said them. When he had enough. But in the end, it's not heartfelt. So he kinda got... What makes me get it? I preferred the question, it is more abandoned. If you turn her, huh? Why is there a community between a popular song and a musical masterpiece? That's it, it's easy. The edit Pierre, well yes, because I think it's edited Pierre, maybe the singer, that means an extraordinary voice. And then in addition, it's the mess. This thing of singing out of tune and perpetually catching the wrong note. It is this kind of system in imbalance. It's not to catch up, because that's going to be the case with any style. I like it a lot, me, I like it a lot, because that's the question I ask myself about everything. So at the level of popular song, I like it, I always had the same pain. But what does it bring new? We heard... Second... Fine. And yes, I say, it's above all things and on all productions, that the question that arises above all is, what new does it bring? If it has been done 10 times 100 times, it can be done very well. But we are done, I understand. Perfectly, does Rob Griez say, when he says... He's Balsak, that's obviously, Sunday Genie. But that it is interesting today to write novels like Balsak by doing. Even more, it dirties Balsak's novels more than that to... Oh, it's like that for everything. So, to what touched me, for example, with an edit-piaf, what is the new line compared to the previous generation, compared to Brother and the other big one of Gérya, and compared to Frère and Damiach, because she brought again, what did she bring, even in the singer's attubnue, in all that, Piaf's voice, I was extremely sensitive to Piaf's voice. In the songs more bandènes, it is necessary to think, for example. When that's what I mean, you have to think about hanging out. What was the novelty of the songs hanging around, but we had never literally, we had never heard singing. Like this, this way, buy it. It's... Now, what I mean, if that's what it invented on this point, for philosophy, for painting, for everything, for art. So whether it's the popular song or whether it's the rest, the same or the sport, we'll see when we go to play sports. But it's exactly the same. What's happening again? So, if we interpret that in the sense of fashion, no, it's the opposite. What's happening again is something that isn't fashionable, that it may become fashionable, but that isn't fashionable, and then we don't try it. By finishes, we do not try it. It's something that makes people wonder. Well, when we treat the Sebers to sing, we list ourselves a madman. A madman, well, today, it seems more like a madman to us. But it is marked end. He was a madman and in a way, he still is. And said, Pierre, that suits you, it seems big enough to me, you find yourself. And that the other Frenchman, you've perished a lot too, you're... The other Frenchman, I thought I saw it right for you. There, I don't know, I thought I saw only French there, on the other hand, too, something new. There are a lot of them, I don't want to name them. It's a big sad thing, that's it. We sang like that, said, seen 100 times, thousands of times. It is, in addition, there is strictly not the slightest voice. He is not looking for anything. At least that makes me just bring something new and look for something. He says, Pierre, what is it dear dear? So there, all I can say is the little health and the big life. What he saw in life, the power of life. And what he broke, etc. And the examples, we could have, badly each time, the name of stone sayings, in what we said close, it's over there. So, French, I was sensitive first, he is looking for something. It looks for the directive of spectare, a bit new, a spectare than the song. He advanced to song spectare, that's what obviously involved the baccalaureate, moreover, but anyway, where you have better, it allows him to make sound heads too. And until the end, he wasn't happy with less than one thing, because it's the lyrics, it was stupidity, and that counts all the same, in the song, the lyrics, it was weak, he passed his decisions to hang these texts and to arrive at qualities of texts greater, like Alexandre and Alexandre, which was a good song, all sangre. So, today, I don't know, but when you watch TV, it's the rights of urtraite, and when I'm tired, I can open on TV. I can say that the more channels there are, the more it seems to be, and the more nullity it is, but a radical nullity, the regime of competition is not to compete with each other, although that may be , it is to produce the same to eterter a nullity, thanks to the competition. And knowing what is going to make the listener, there is to listen to him here rather clearly, but it was farant, the way he says, we can even call that a field, we can even no longer call it first because the voice does not exist, there is no longer any right, there is no more. But hey, don't forget neither we don't. I mean, what touches me is a kind of area that would be how to be shaped by popular song and by music. Yet, and what is it, huh? So with Phélix, I think we did a good job, because it's one thing and he feels me, when I said, I could say in a pinch, if someone told me, but what a philosophical concept, you have product, and if you talk about creating concepts, we have at least produced a very important philosophical concept, that of Ritournel. And the Ritournel, it's for me, it's this point like that. Because, what that, let's put it, the Ritournel, it's a small field. Here, here, here, here. When do I say, here, here. I do philosophy, that's it. But of philosophy, I say to myself when did I do, that I sing in, I say that I sing in three occasions, I sing in when I make a sister, and that I followed my mables, there has a radio background, that is to say that when I am at home, I sing in when I am not at home, and I try to regain the scheme, when at night, during anxiety, I look for my way and I give myself courage by singing between there. I go to my diagram. And then, I sing when I say to God, I leave, and in my heart, I will carry. It's also, all these popular songs, to God, I leave, and in my heart, I will take, when I leave my house to go to God, to go where. In other words, one of my tournels for me is absolutely linked, to that puts us back to ha, to d'y mal, to the problem of territory, and of leaving or entering a territory, it's that is to say, to the problem of detertoriatization. I return to my territory, where I try, or else I deteritorialize myself, to say, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving my territory. You come, but she doesn't with the music. You have to progress when you create a council, for that, I avoke the image of the brain. It would be necessary to take my brain at this moment, presently, that I say to myself, the vacuum. What is a void, a void, that was always that. Everything I would have been the voice as song, which is absence, song, according to its positions in relation to the territories. My territory, the territory that I no longer have, the territory that I am trying to regain, that's what a leader is, whether it's at Chouberg, that's basically it. And I think that's it, that's what affects him. L'enceux jise is music, it's the story of becomings, of the powers of becoming. It was something like that. Well, then, it wants to be great, or it can be mediocre. But... What then is truly great music? It seems like an operation to me, in fact, the music artist operation. But it's really that they start from Ritournel, I don't know, I'm even talking about the most abstract musicians. I understand that everyone is a type of Ritournel. He talks about little aeros, he talks about little Ritournelis. You have to see the proust twenty-eels, three notes and then two. There is a little Ritournel at the base of Touvate, there is the base of September and of... It's from Ritournel. You have to find it in the music under the music, the Ritournel. It is something prodigious. And then what happens? He's a great musician. It's not Ritourvels which me one after the other. But it's Ritournels that will melt into an even deeper Ritournel. It's all the Ritournels, almost territories, from such territories, to territories that are going to be organized within a kind of immense, whereas we must say immense Ritournel, which is a cosmic Ritournel. All that Stochhausen says about music and the cosmos is to take up themes that were commonplace by an employee with a lot of sense. But I'm very much for case satisfaction. Music relates to the cosmos in a way. Good, well, I take a musician, while I also admire a lot and who touches me a lot of misfortune. What are side chambers? The rooms weren't good, can't say better. It is perpetually, like an element of youth. You perpetually have a little Ritournel, sometimes based on two bells and two cows. Yes, it's unfortunate. It was extremely moving the way in which all these little Ritournel which are already brilliant musical works, Ritournel de tavern, Ritournel de Berger, Ritournel, etc. Arrange to be composed in a kind of great Ritournel which will be the side room. So, another example was needed, I would say really Bartok who was probing. Obviously, he is an immense musician, a very, very great genius. The way in which local jingles, national minority jingles, etc. are taken up in a work, in a work that we have not finished exploring. So, I think that music is a bit... Yes, to unite it with painting, it's exactly the same thing. When Clé says Iran boss Paul Visible, Iran Visible implies forces that are not visible. Musicia is the same thing. Iran audible forces that are not audible. Iran by the audible, Iran audible, something that didn't smash her. Iran audible earth music. Iran audible music from the front, etc. Exactly, almost like the philosopher, will go thinkable forces which are not thinkable, which are rather of a brutal nature, of a brutal nature. So it's this communion of the little ritornello with the big ritornello, which didn't define music for me. That would be it, and that mighty. It's powerful to carry on a truly cosmic level. It's as if the stars are churning to sing a little air of a bell and a cow, a little air of a shepherd. It is rather the reverse. Bells and cows are suddenly raised to the status of saleste noise or business noise of one, to do our. That's what... But still I have the impression I won't be explained why. Everything you tell me and this musical tradition, that what you are looking for in music, the refrain, is still visual. That you, your business is the visual. Much more. So, I understand that the point the dible is linked to the cosmic force like the visual. But you don't go to the concert, you know what bothers you, you don't listen to music, whereas the exhibitions, you go at least once a week, and you have a practice. It's not just a possibility, but in fact, there is only one answer I can make. A single fundamental interested day in a literature is style. Style is auditory. It is the auditory pu. I don't know the distinction you make between the vis-vel. When I rarely go to a concert, because it's more difficult to hold your place before. It's part of life and very practical life. As long as the gallery is a painting exhibition, you won't retain its place before. But every time I've been to the concert, I always find it too long, because I have very little receptivity. But I always read quite emotions. There, I think, I'm not sure you're right, but I think you're wrong anyway. That's not entirely true. In any case, I know that the music will give emotions. It's not raining, it's even more difficult. Talking about music is even more difficult than talking about painting. It's almost the top talking about music. That's almost the whole thread... Well, a lot of philosophers have talked about music. No, he's not a kiss, she's just interested. The sound is level. Music, it is linked, philosophy. That is to say, many philosophers have spoken of the Gentile and the Elijah. There are many that we talk about music. Yes. Yes Yes Yes. And beyond Opontia, there are few who have spoken of painting. There are few, you think, I don't know. No I do not know. I don't know, I'm not sure. The music is off, you were talking about it, I was talking about it fast, I was talking about it. Yes, he spoke it well, he spoke cabbage well. Run, we talked. Who it takes neck? Yeah, he didn't talk much about the music. It was a secret with him. Yes, it was a secret. It's the part of the music, you have a secret. He had still been very close to musicians. Yes, yes, yes, he told me “Socret” all that. He didn't talk about it. Yes, but he was going to Bayreux, he was very close to my musical. He said &quot;Socret&quot; to me? Yes yes. Yes yes. Yes yes. And the berg exception, as Pierre André breathes, which we passed through the Asse, why the cliché? Where does this... it's part of it come to me, it's part of it too, and why and to see you in something? I do not know why. Because I discovered at the same time as the pieces for orchestra of... Oh, listen. You see what that, an old woman, not everything is comfortable. Than his master's orchestral pieces. From Games bergs. And I remember, to myself, not too long ago, I could put the pieces for orchestra. But 15 times in a row. And I knew my moms, the moms who upset me. And it's to himself, at the same time that I found berg, and he then made me him, I would have listened to him all day, yes, why? Me, I believe that you are also there, the question of the relationship with the earth. Unfortunately, I don't escape until much later. It's music and earth. Dip it again in the very old musicians, there was called me, the music and the earth. But that the music is understood from the earth to that extent, as she loved it, and I am unhappy. I found it upsetting, yes. Make sound, the mighty ones of the earth. It was his flip-flop for me. It was a great text because it is the music of the earth. It is a great work. He is from Crite, but very much the Crite-Marrie. Ah, the Crite-Marrie, for me the song is from Crite-Marrie. It is brought back between the song and the Crite, and one is fresh. All this school has surposed the problem. But the two seizures, I didn't get it from the Crite-Marrie. Horizontal Crite-Marrie that crushes the earth. In Voïte-Sèque, and vertical Crite-Marrie. And the completely vertical Crite-Marrie of the contest. The dispute, the baroness, I no longer know. Contests it in Loulou. It's like two such top of Crite. But the relationship between... All that, that interests me too, if we also philosophize, there are songs and cries. Concepts are veritable songs in philosophy. And then there are cries of philosophy. There are cries of a course at Ristotte. We have to stop. Or to another who will say. No, I never stop. I don't know what maybe yet. We don't even know what maybe yet. That's screams. It's... Woe to port, cheating or affect concept. It's a bit the same. It's good for me. It's something that touches me.
