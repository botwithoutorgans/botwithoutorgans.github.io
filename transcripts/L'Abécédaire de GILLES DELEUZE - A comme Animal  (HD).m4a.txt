You chose an embassy, you warned me about the themes and there I don't know exactly the questions, it's me, I haven't thought about the theme a little anymore. It is an answer to a question without having thought a little, it is for me something of a comsimable to what. When he saves us, that's the clause. The clause is all that to be reused, if it is usable, to be reused only after my death. So you understand, I already feel reduced to the state of a pure archive of Pierre André Boutan, sheets of paper and it brings me back a lot, it consumes a lot of it, and almost to a state of pure spirit, I'm talking after my death and we know that he's done with having turned the state of pure mind, he's not someone who gives very deep, very intelligent answers, it's a bit simple. So everything goes, everything goes in there, we start, it's to help what you want. Alright, let's start with a. So it's animal. So, animal, we can take WCfield's sentence for you, a man who has neither children nor animals cannot be completely bad. So, we're going to leave the children aside for the moment, but the pets know that you don't like them very much, well, we don't know, but I know that you don't like them very much, and there you don't even take the distinction de laur de Côque-Taux, dear ones are no better than dogs for you. On the other hand, you have a beast through your work which is rather repulsive, that is to say, in addition to fakes, which are noble animals, you talk a lot about the type of louse, a certain number of small animals like that repugnant. And what I would like to add is that the animals in addition, you have been used a lot since the Antille of Ipe, a concept which has become principal in your work, which is becoming animal. So, I would like to know a bit clearly what your relationship is with animals. The animals are not, yes. What you said is there if it goes to me in relation to domestic animals, it's not a domestic animal, an animal to be expected wild, that's not what worries me. The songs, the dogs, the problem is my pets and familios. And it's true that pets or familios that are intended to be domesticated, I don't fight. On the other hand, domesticated, unfamiliar, unfamiliar animals, I don't like because I'm sensitive to something in those. So, what didn't happen is for me, what happens in many families, I was without a candle who has, and then our children, in my family, bring in these little hands, a shock was no greater than aptness. They had found him somewhere in the countryside, they had found him in a payet, in this country, I don't know what. And from that fateful moment, I always had a cat at home. So, what displeased me? Finally, it's not going to be a nightmare, I'm worn. What displeased me? I don't like scrubbers already. A passing cat rubbing against you. I do not like that. A cat is something else, so what I basically blame chins for is barking. The limp will really speak, but the most stupid cry, God who described in nature, there is a barrie was written, the limp, it is really the circle of the animal kingdom. I support in range, I support better, provided it is not too long, the cry I do not know how to say, the howling at the moon. Dog howling at the moon, I bear better than death. I don't know what, I can tolerate brumard better than there. And then since I recently learned that dogs and cats rub social security, my antipathy has increased even more. What I'm going to say is that it's very important, at the same time what I'm saying is completely silly because people who really like cats and dogs obviously have something to do with dogs. and cats that aren't human. They have with dogs and cats, for example children, we can clearly see that children have with a cat, a relationship which is not a human relationship with the cat, which is a kind of relationship either frontin, or which is a species. The importance is to have an animal relationship with the animal. So why does the animal relationship with the animal consist of talking to him, in any case what I can't stand is the human relationship with the animal. I know what I'm saying because I say a street there, which is a bit deserted and where people walk their dogs. What I hear my window is properly and beacon, and beacon, the way people can steal it from them. So even the apsicanalysre marks, the apsicanalysre is so attached to pets, to local families, to family animals, that everything is animal in a dream. For example in dreams, is interpreted by apsicanalysis as an image of peace, mayor or children. That is, the animal as a member of the family. It's to the gods, I can't stand it. You have to think of two chèdes of a great from Doignais Rousseau, the dog in the cart which is really the big pair, the big worst at the tapure, and then the war horse, the war horse, which is a real beast. The question is that it relates to living with the animal. If you have a human relationship with the animal, but generally when people who love animals don't have a human relationship with the animal, they have an animal relationship with the animal, and that's very good . Even hunters, even for you, I don't hunters, even hunters have an amazing relationship with animals. So I think there's a band and in addition, the other animals, it's true that I'm fascinated by meters like stoppers, ticks, ends, or that, it's as important as chains singing them, and it's animal relations too, someone who has ticks, who has ends, what that means is animal relations that are very active. So what fascinates me in the animal because really, I was helped by certain animals and fed by my fascination for many animals. What, here, will I make it count to tell me what strikes me in the animal? The first thing that strikes me, I think, is the fact that every animal has a world. It's that, yes, there are levels of people, there are levels of humans who don't have a gang. He lives the life of everyone, that is to say of a portu which is of a portu what, the animals, they have orders. What is an animal world? It is sometimes extraordinarily restricted. And that's what pleases me. The animals, they ultimately react to very few things. There are all sorts of things which, if you see that... I'm working on it, Bobin II, wait a second. When you want ? Yes, in this story, this first trait of the animal is really the existence of... of worlds with particular specific immos. And maybe... It's sometimes the poor head, it's my, the reduction, the reduced character, it's my, of one that interests me a lot. For example, we were talking earlier about a property like ICT. ICT responds to reacts to three things. Three exciting, one point that's all in a nature that is an immense nature. Three exciting, one point that's all. That is to say, she holds you towards the end of a tree branch, drawn towards the light. She can wait at the end at the top of this branch. She can wait for years without eating, without anything, completes her... Amorfe. She waits for a ruminant, a herbivore, an animal, not under her branch. Then, to blur it, there, it's a kind of olfactory excitement. She gets tired of it without the beast that passes under her branch. That's exciting second. The humian is then host. And then, when she has fallen on our palm, she goes to look for the area with the least hair. So, there, an active stimulant. It sinks under the skin. The rest she leaves. If we can say, she doesn't give a damn. In a providing nature, she extracts the selection of three things. This is your dream of life. That's what interests you in animals. That's what makes a world. That's what makes a world. Whence your animal relation to writing, that is to say that writing in vein for you is also someone who has a world. It's more complicated. He can refuse it not because there are other aspects. It is not enough to have a world to be an animal. What is easily completely is the business of territory. And with Phélix, we really created a concept of...almost a philosophical concept with the idea of territory. Animals with territory, there are animals without territory. Territory animals are prodigious. Because constituted in territory, for me, it is almost the anessence of art. When we see how an animal marks its territory, everyone knows, everyone will always have the stories of gland in nalle, of the ryne, of... the wedges, it marks the borders of its territory. But it goes way beyond that. What intervenes in the marking of territory is also a series of postures. For example, this lowered stand up. A series of colors. The drys, for example, the colors of the buttocks of the drys, which they manifest at the border of the territory. What colors sing postures. These are the three determinations of art. I mean, the color, the lines, the animal postures are sometimes real lines. Colors, lines, songs. It's pure ralette. And then, when they leave their territory, or when they return to their territory, their behavior, the territory, is the domain of the path. It's very curious that it's in the way. That is to say my properties. My properties as the winnower of biquettes, biquettes or the winnower of michaux. The intervitory is the properties of the animal. And get out of the territory, that's it, go get it. There are beasts that recognize their spouses. They recognize in the territory, but they don't recognize out of the territory. All that, those wonders, I don't know what or not. It's the voice, I don't know. You have to believe me. And then, so with Phoenix, I leave the blow of the animal, I can follow a philosophical problem because one mixes a little all in the lowering of air. I say to myself, we sometimes approach philosophers to create my barbarians. But to me, put yourself in my place. For given reasons, I want to think about this notion of territory. And I say to myself, the territory is worth me in relation to a movement in which we leave it. So we have to put that together. I need a word that we appear barbaric. From then on, with Phoenix, we built a concept that I like very much, which is that of territorialisations. We are told on this, it is a hard word to say. Then, that means the need for that. There, it's a very Caouin word, a philosophical concept, perhaps disguised only by a word that doesn't yet exist. Even if we later discover that in other languages there was the equivalent. For example, then I realized that in Mellville, I kept coming across the word “Aoutlandish”. And “Aoutlandish”, finally, I was taking at the moment, you correct it yourself, “Aoutlandish”, it is exactly the deterritorialized. It's a word of your word. So, I say for philosophy before coming back to the indibots, for philosophy, it's very striking. It is very striking. We sometimes need to come up with a word like barbarian. To account for a notion after new tension, the notion after new tension is that there is no territory, without a vector of exit from the territory, there is no exit from the territory, that is to say of deterritorialization, it goes at the same time to the effort for those to withdraw the elsewheres, those of something else. So all that plays into animals, that's what fascinates me. What fascinates me on the whole is the whole domain of signs. Animals emit signs. They do not know to resign signs. They produce signs, that is, to double-send and react to signs. For example, an arrenier, anything that touches its web. He doesn't react to just anything, he reacts to signs and he has signs, he produces signs. For example, the famous signs, is it a water sign, is it something else? I won't really go for people who know how to recognize, for example hunters, real hunters, hunters from hunting companies, but real hunters who know how to recognize the animal that has been there. At this time, animals are animals. At this time, animals are animals. That's it, an animal relationship with the animal. It's there, well, it's there. But it is this emission of signs, this reception of signs which approaches writing and writing and writing and writing. If I'm really going to say to myself, what is it for you that being an animal, you won't have anything real? It is being to the agents. It is basically a being for agents. Like writing? And the writing, well, the writing, yes, all the agents. The philosopher, all agents. The almond is with the agents. For me, the animal, you see, you see the animal ears, but it does nothing without being with the agents. We never quieted her down. It has never been quiet animal. He eats, he has to watch if he comes in the back, if something happens in the back, he will come next, etc. It's terrible, it's existing on his war. So you make the connection with the writing and that it will rot between the animal. He had me. It's true. I am brother. It would almost be necessary to say at the limit of inwriting, what is it? Of course, he writes for indescriptive voters. But what does that mean for? It means for... A writer, he writes for the reader. In a sense, he writes for voters. It must also be said that the writer writes for non-readers, that is to say not for the intention of one, but instead. For that means two things. It means in intention and then it means instead. So Arthur writes pockets that everyone knows. I write for the Adan Fabette. I write for idioms. It must have been written for the idioms. It means so that the idioms have it... It means so that the Adan Fabettes have it instead. I mean that I write instead of savages. I write instead of animals. And what does that mean? Why our russures like that? I write instead of Adan Fabette, idioms, beasts. Well because that's what we do instead when we write. When you write, you're not conducting a little private business. It's really the assholes. It's really the coiling, the literary mediocrity of all times, but particularly, that makes people believe to write a novel, for example, all you need is a little private affair, a little affair of one's own. He's a great mayor who died of cancer, his own love story, and then, he's going to write a novel. But it's a shame, it's a shame, it's things like that. It's not making it private to someone in writing. It's really getting into a universal business. And whether the novel or the philosophy, then what does that mean? Childish, third babbling. Wait a second. THANKS. So, it was written for, that is to say, for the intention and instead of, it's a bit like what you said in Mille Plateau, about Chandô, it's off-manchital , in the very beautiful sentence, that the writer is inspired because he lives the animal as the only population to which he is responsible. That's it, that's absolutely it. And for a reason, that, I believe, is all that, it's not this whole product, literary declarations, it's the daily life of Irde-Eufmanstarr. This is another thing. It's because writing is necessarily pushing language and pushing the holy axis because language is pushing the holy axis to a certain limit. A limit who, what, bah, which can be expressed in several ways, it is just as much the limit which separates language from silence, as the limit which separates language from music, as the limit which separates language from something that would be what. Bah, let's say, if I say, the purely, the purely painful. But not the limp, especially. We see a name right away, not the limp, and again, who knows, you could have a writer arrive, the purely painful, all we say to ourselves, well yes, my Kafka, it's the metamorphosis, the manager who writes, you have heard, it sounds like an animal. Then high the painful world of Gregor, or the people of mice, we write for the people of mice, for the people of rachimeurs. Because contrary to what they say, it's not men who fall in love, it's animals and men when they die like animals. There, then we come back to the cat and with great respect, I had among the many cats who succeeded here. There is a little cat who died quite quickly, that is to say, I saw what many people saw too, how an animal looks for what to die. If there is a territory for death too, there is a search for the hospital of death, for the territory where one can die. There is this bottomless and in a known language, in an ancle, it was raco, as if it was the right place for him to die. Yes, in meaning, if writing is indeed survival, which pushes language to the limit, the limit which separates language from animality, which separates language from the cry, which separates language from the field. In that moment, you have to say yes, the writing is responsible in front of the laughing animals. He is responsible for having animals that laugh, that is to say, to answer for animals that laugh. Write good, literally not rotten, that I'm not going to write to eat, to eat, but to write laughing animals, etc. It is to carry language to this limit. There is no literature that carries through language and the holy axis, to this limit that separates language from animality. You have to be sure, it even limits. Me, I think. Even when we do philosophy, that's it. When we do, we are on the limit that separates thought from the anomalous. You must always be at the limit that separates you from animality, but precisely in such a way begins, more separated. There is an inherent inhumanity to the human body and the human mind. There are relationships to be said for with the animal. Well, if we were done can, that would be good.
