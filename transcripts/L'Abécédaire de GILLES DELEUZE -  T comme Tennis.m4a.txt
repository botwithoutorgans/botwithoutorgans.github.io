So you've always been this tennis player? Tennis. You have always loved tennis. A famous anecdote where as a child was chased away from our graph, with a great player it's black and you realized that it was the king of Sweden who finally asked you for our graph. No, I had that all the same, he really bothered you with people. He got you, he had a whole bodyguard. Yeah yeah yeah. That I had been asked in our graph to the King of Sweden, yes. Le Figaro had photographed me at the time, there is a photo in Le Figaro where there is a little boy who asks our graph to the old king of Sweden, it's me. And it was that great Swedish player that you could hunt? No, it's my retirement. It was not a great Swedish player, it was my retiree who was the main bodyguard of the king of Sweden since he played tennis with him, he trained him and kicked me to get me to approach not from the king. But the king was very nice, the barretrait has become very nice. That's not a brilliant page for retirement. It has much less shine for the body. Is that the only sport you watch on TV, tennis? Oh no, I love her football, me. What do I like football? Yes, I believe it's all football and tennis. And you played tennis? Yes a lot. More than at war, I am a victim of war. Oh yeah. And what does it change in your body when you practice tennis, when you practice more afterwards? There are things. I don't know, no. Finally, for me, not so much, I didn't make it my job. I was 14, 39, it was... I'm 14, I quit tennis at 14. We get you a drape. You well, I'm not? Ah, I was playing well for 14 years, I was just doing that. So, I was playing well, yes. You were ranking. Oh no, 14 years old. So, for small, then it had no development at all. It has tennis today. And to tackle other sports, French boxing, I believe. Oh no, he does a little boxing, but I was hurt, I stopped right away. Yes yes. Yes, I did a little boxing, yes. And you think tennis has changed a lot since you were young? Well, that raises all sports. The sports there too, it is the media of variation. So, we find them problems of style. Oh, it's very interesting sport because it's the question of the attitudes of the body. There is a variation of the attitudes of the body which are on spaces, long spaces, more or less not. For example, it's obvious that we don't jump the haides in the same way. Now 50 years ago. I say... And the variables should be classified in the story of hope. Because there are tactical variables in football, tactics have changed tremendously. On my childhood, there are body postures attitude variables. There are long pond variables. But I crossed over at one point, I was interested in the shot put to do it myself. But because the weight thrower templates have evolved at some point earlier. Tanto, it was about power. But how, with very powerful launchers, to recover speed, sometimes fast templates. But how by putting speed as the first element to recover power? That's very interesting. It's almost the word sociologist, it's going to launch all sorts of studies on body attitudes in civilizations. But sport, what an area of variation in attitudes, quite formamental. So, in Thédisme, even before the war, where I remember the champions before the war, it is obvious. The attitudes were not the same, not at all. And then, what interests me a lot, so we come a little to the problems of style, it is the champions who are really creative. There are two kinds of great champions that don't have the same value for me. Creators and poker players. The poker players are what bring an already existing, powerless, unequaled style. I would say, for example, endol is not fundamentally creative. And then, in Thedism, the great creators, that is to say, even at the level to speak quite simply, who invent new moves, who introduce new tactics. And on that, without a waffle, everything comes out as a follower. But great designers are inventors. It's true in terms of sports altogether. So, I tell myself that there was the great turning point of Thedism. It is a proletarization, proletarization, all relative. I mean, it's become a mass sport. Massive rather, I therefore do not prolobe, but in fact, let's take a plunge into the proletarianization of Thedism. However, of course, there were deep movements to explain that this is done. But it wouldn't be done if there hadn't been a genie at the same time. It was edge that ensured. Why not here, bring the style of mass inténice. He had to create him from start to finish. Then it's swallowed up by very good champions, but not creators of the Vila type, etc. But edge, it suits me very well. It helps you from Christ, and he had a space of Christic air, this extremity, this tee shot, that he was respected by all the players, etc. Did you say on camera? You said on camera, I attended. Ah yes, I witnessed a lot of things, we tell you, yes. But I said to myself on edge there, edge, it is therefore a Christic character. He has on mass sport, he creates mass tennis. And all that implies the total invention of a new game. we always find the law. I am you, you are congratulating me, I am healthy instead of what I did to you. Because on board him, he changes. He changes when he has secured his shot, it interests him more. It evolves the edge style to evolve, evolve. As long as the tasks have remained a bit in the same thing. So you have to say the antiboard, you liked gold. It was what ? What... What is the Trolot style that imposed it? The past ? At the bottom of the course, the absolute collection and the lifting. And the top of the net. Anything for the other, we can understand that. We any small frame, we can understand this game there. I'm not saying he can. It's interesting. The very principle. Bottom line, facelift, bottom up, is the opposite of istocratic principles. These are the popular principles. Simply that she gets in the way, you shouldn't... Borgue, it's exactly like the Jesus, like the Lotheliste. He is an aristocrat who goes to the people. It's finally I have stupidity. And well, it was an astonishing blow, astonishing the blow Borgue. Very very curious, a great creator, in sport. And there was my cane who was a pure aristocrat to him. A kind of aristocrat, half Gypsian, half Russian, service, who invented his tricks for him. So he knew no one could follow him. She's the aristocrat who doesn't want to be followed. While he did invent prodigious shots, in particular, he invented a shot which consists of putting the ball down. Very curious, he has no pose. He did a stolen serve combo. Who wasn't? It was well known. The stolen service sequence. But that of Borgue de Bacquette Roue, absolutely. All that, we could talk about Chagat. Another great, then, but not of the same importance, I believe. He's the other American, I don't know his name anymore. Connors. Connors, who, then, we can clearly see the aristocratic principle of the flat ball. The refusal of the infinite, the flat ball, and skimming the net. That is a very, very curious aristocratic principle. And strike out of balance. Never, never, never, never, does he have so many genes when he's completely unbalanced. It is curious coexamination. There is a story of hope. It should be said that it does not all sports. Their evolution, the creators, the followers. Those exactly like in the bows. There are creators, there are followers. There are changes, there are developments. There is the story. There is a becoming. You started a sentence with &quot;I attended&quot;. That's one more detail. I believe I attended. It's not hard to assign the origin of a move. I remembered before the war, there were the Australians. Here too, there are questions of nation. For what ? Why did the Aussies who were backhanding the backhand? At the start of the two-handed backhand, there were the Aussies doing it. In my memory, I believe. In any case, it is an Australian invention. For what ? The Australians, the relationship between the two-handed backhand, the Australians, it's not obvious. I don't know, maybe there's a reason. But I remember a blow that hit me at the end. Because it had no effect. You could see that the other was missing it, that the elimit was missing it. But we thought to ourselves why it had been a rather soft blow. Then we think about it well. We realized that was their place. When the opponent served, then the player returned the serve. And returned a rather soft blow, but which had the property of falling exactly on the end of the feet. From the server that was rising on the fly. And who served them, not even in mivoli, who couldn't take them. It was a funny thing because we said to ourselves, what is that? We didn't really understand why it was a hit here, gargnancy. And in my opinion, the first to have, in any case, systematized that. He was a very great Australian player who didn't have a great career on curves, on rebattu. It didn't interest anyone who was called Bromwich, which must have been just before the war or just after the war, I don't even remember. And who was a very, very great player and he also had an inventory of blows. And that, I remember, in hunger, in hunger for young men, my scoulat astonishment which has now become classic, that all are but here it is, only with a sudden invention, to my knowledge, the generation of withdrawal , all that was not, when she does not try to scoulat in tennis. It has me to give back. Well, finish and at all, it's my caneure, you think when he insulted the referee. And in fact, he insults himself much more than he insults the referee. It is a matter of style which is not content with its expression. No, it's a style thing because it's part of his style. It's nervous research, it's... Yes, that. Just as a speaker can get angry and there are speakers who have very icy, finally it is fully part of style. So he likes it, that's the gun, that's how it looks in German. The moan, the moan, the moan.
