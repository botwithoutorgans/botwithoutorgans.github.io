So, hope, we'll go to D on these entrofettes. Oh yeah ? So, for D, I need my paper, because I'm going to read what's in the redhead. A little redhead illustrated in Duleuse, who is also crushed with a D. So there is Duleuse, Gilles, French philosophy, neaparied in 1927. 25, sorry. I was done in the red, not the gold, huh. Here, today, we are in 80 luches. All before they... With Felix Guatari, he shows the importance of desire and its revolutionary aspect in the face of any institution. Even since analytical. And he puts, as they demonstrate in all this, the Antillean d'y, during 72. So, precisely, since you pass in the eyes of all for the philosophers of desire, I will have how one speaks of desire. So what was desire, exactly? Take the question, quite simply, of the world, when the Antille d'y... Yeah, it's not sure. It wasn't what we thought, anyway. Filer, it's not what we thought, but well, at that time, even I say it, the most vocal people, well, who were... It was... It was a great ambiguity. It was a big misunderstanding, all the same, a small misunderstanding, all the same, a very small misunderstanding. I think we meant one thing, but really very simple. If we really had a great ambition, namely that... until that, when we write a book, it's because we claim to say something completely false. We pretended that in one way or another, the people before us, they hadn't really understood what desire was, that is to say, we were making an octage of philosophers, we claimed to be proposing a new concept of desire. But in concepts, you mustn't believe that... People mustn't, when they're not doing philosophy, believe that a concept is very abstract. On the contrary, it sends things back extremely, it's an extremely concrete appeal, we'll see, it's... almost it sends back. There is no philosophical concept that will render to non-philosophical ends. It's very... It's very... Very very concrete. We wanted to say something simpler in the world. We meant, until now, you speak abstractly of desire, because you extract an object supposed to be the object of your desire. So, you can say, I wanted a woman, I want to leave, to take such a trip, I want these that. And we were saying a very simple thing. Really, simple, simple. You never desire anyone, or anything. You always want a set. It's not complicated. And our question was what is the nature of the relationships between elements for there to be desire, for it to become desirable. I mean, I don't want a woman. There, I am ashamed to say things like that. It's proust, there, d'y... It's beautiful, I have proust. I don't want a woman. I also desire a landscape that is wanting to pay in this woman. Landscape that you need, I don't know, that I sense. What if, since I hadn't unrolled the landscape that she blopped. I wouldn't be happy, that is. My desire will not be stupefied. My desire will remain satisfied. There, I take a two-tier set, a landscape woman. It is quite another thing. When a woman says, I want a dress, I want that, such a blouse. It's obvious that she doesn't want such a blouse in the abstract. It is desire in a whole context, which is a context of her own life that she is going to organize. The desire will have bearing with, not only a landscape, but with people who have his friends or with people who are not his friends, with his profession, with, etc. I never desire anything from everyone. I want, much more, I don't want a set, either. I desire in a set. So, there, we could come back, it's at the end time. There, we were talking earlier about drinking alcohol. But, to drink, that never meant to say, I desire. I want to drink. So there. Where does that mean? I want to drink alone while working or drink alone while resting or go find friends to drink. Go to such a little cafe. In other words, there is no desire that doesn't flow, I tell myself, that doesn't flow, that doesn't flow in an assemblage. It's good that desire, for me, has always been, if I look for the abstract term that corresponds to desire, I would say, it's constructivism. To desire is to construct an arrangement. It is building a whole. The set of a skirt, a ray of sunshine, a street, that's it. The arrangement of a faint, of a landscape, of a color, that is what desire is. It is therefore to construct an assemblage, to construct a region. It's building, it's really agency. Desire is constructivism. I say, we, the whole thing is said, who is that, there are others. We have to do it, yes. It is precisely because it is an assemblage that you need, you needed, at that moment, to be two, to welcome that it was in a whole that Phélix was needed, who appeared at this that moment, of the uncreated life. Would Phélix, there, that would also be part of what we might have to say about the profession of the relationship of philosophy with something that concerns the profession, but surely that with Phélix, we have make an arrangement, yes. We can, there are agencies all by itself, once again, there are agencies in 2. Phélix, all we have done, Phélix, is an arrangement in 2, or something passes between the two. That is to say, all that is physical phenomena. It's like a difference, for an event to happen, there needs to be a difference in potential. For there to be different potentians, make two levels, there must be two, at that moment, something happens, a flash passes or not a flash, or a stream, a small stream, well, and it's from the lady of desire. As desired, it is quite built. Constructed, however, each of us passes without a track, constructed, each who says, turning, each, someone who has said, I desire this, that means that he has entered to construct agencies. And it's nothing else. Desire ringing, look. You are still waiting. Not of my silk that in truth. You're going to do it anyway, go for it. So precisely, it's a coincidence if it's... because the desire has been proven, finally, exists in a set, where we're going to only arrange, the Antille of hyp, or you speak of desires, or you... How is it going to talk about desire? And the first book you write with someone else, that is to say with Felix Guatari. Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. It's a fallin' tool, where we enter into this arrangement, new for us, writes Radou, which has been... Which is... the same way. For something to pass, that is to say that there is what she wants to pass, it was ultimately a hostility, a reaction against the dominant conceptions of desire, the psychonalitic conceptions. It had to be egg, Felix goes into apsychonalism. Me, being interested in this subject, it took all that for... We say to ourselves, there was reason to make the conception, well, constructive, constructivist of desire. Yeah. And could you better, like that, define rather quickly, successively, how you see the difference between, precisely, this constructivism, interpretation, analytics, well, we can clearly see, but there are... Oh, that's all. Me, I think that's all. I will say our position, apsychonalism. It is multiple, but when there is a problem of desire, it is because, really, the apsychonalist speaks of desire, exactly as priests speak. He doesn't know the only one, it's not the only connection, it's priests, it's priests, the apsychonalist. They talk about it in what form, they talk about it in the form of a great complaint about castration, what. Castration is worse, it's worse than the original sin, castration is a kind of curse on desire which is truly appalling. So, what did we try to do, we, in the antiter, said, I believe there are three points. There are three points which arise directly for the apsychonalist. These three points are... And there, for my part, and I believe that neither Phélix nor Vélégisouatari, we have absolutely nothing to change, it's three points. It's that... that we are convinced, or believing, in any case, that the unconscious is not a theatre. It's not a place where there's been a chard who's staggeringly playing their scene. It's not a theatre, it's a factory, it's production. The unconscious is produced. He produces, it doesn't do without a product. So it works like a factory. It is the benevolent opposite of the psychonalitic vision and of consciousness as theatre, where things always linger on the sidelines, or on the infinite team. Our second theme is that delirium, which is closely linked to desire, when desire is delirious in a certain way, but if you look at any delirium, if you look at our press, if you hear about delirium whatever it is, it has nothing before on the apsychrialising of a burp of seduce, that is to say, one does not delirious on his father and his mother. And we're delirious about something completely different, and that's where delirium is created, we're delirious about the anti world. That is to say, we are delirious about history, geography, the etribue, the helper, the epupe, the climin, the airace, the ecliban, it is on this that we are delirious . The world of delirium is... I'm a beast, an agro, a handsome. It's where the tribes are, how to arrange the tribes, survive in the desert, etc. The desert is the delirium and geography of copolitics. And the apsychrialis each time, it reverts to family determinations. So I can say, there, I feel, even after time of years of distance, after him whole, I say, the apsychrialis of a chaperian understood, a pleasant fact of delirium. We rave the world, we don't rave about our little family. For that, all that, it overlaps, when I said literature, it's not someone's little private gift. It amounts to the same thing, delirium too, it's not delirium about the father and the mother. And then the third point is that it comes down to the room of irres, it's that delirium is always his, he builds agencies, he's his in an arrangement, he always goes play several factors. And the apsychrialis of 16 of ours comes down to a single factor. He always the father, sometimes the father, sometimes the mother, sometimes the necessary, etc. And there, everything has a rank of what is multiplied, there, everything has a rank of constructivism, that is to say of agencies. I will give examples. We were talking about food earlier. For the apsychrialis, food is an image of a father, but your... A chouin is an image of a father. It's crazy in the world. I am thinking of the example of the petitance. The petitance is a child on whom, Freddon, his opinion, he assists a chouin in the street who falls and the chartier who lives the age of whippings. And the chouin who kicks, who kicks everywhere, well, before the car, before the automobile, it was at the show running through the streets. Must have been something for a kid. The first time that a kid travels, I do, who falls in the street, and that... that cuddled half drunk, tried to lift a whiplash, but it must have been an emotion. It... It got to you... It happened to you on the street. That has you... The event in the street, sometimes all of that was a bloody event. And then we hear, it's the épsicale at ease to speak, finally, imagine a pair, etc. But it's... It's in their head that it's wrong... The desire, that the desire was concerned by a chouin of the grave and beaten in the street. A death cabbage in the street, etc. But it is an arrangement. It's a fantastic arrangement to be... It's too white all the way to the bottom. Another example, I can say so... Another example... We were talking about the animal. What is it to the animal, but there isn't... An animal that would be an image of the father. Animals generally, it goes parmûte. It's musts, good. It's musts. There is a term that pleases me very much, it is very very that I adore. It's... It's Jung. It is who agrees with Freud after the long collaboration. Jung will account to Freud that he had a dream of another night. He dreamed of an osseware. And Freud does not understand anything literally. He tells her all the time. If you dreamed of a bone, it means... Someone's death. It says to someone's death. And really Jung, in 16 of him, I'm not talking about a bone. I dreamed of an osseware, an osseware. Freud does not understand. He doesn't see the difference between an osseware and an osse. It tells you an osseware, it's... It's a bone. It's a thousand bones. That's 10,000 bones. That is multiplicity. That's an agency. He's a... He's a probing twin in osseware. What does that mean? What... What is it through which desire passes? In an arrangement, it is always a collective. Collective, constructivist, etc. That's desire. So where does desire pass me, among these thousand crates, these thousand bones or pass me desire in the pack? At what position in the pack? Am I outside the pack, next to the pack, in the pack, in the center of the pack? These are all phenomena of challenge. That's desire. But this collective arrangement, precisely, like the Antiédie Petalif which was written in 72, it was a collective arrangement, arrived at the point named after 68, that is to say that it was a whole reflection of those years- there, and against the apsychoanalysis which continued its business of small-desires. And nothing to the opinette what to say, the delirium, delirium, the érasse and the tribes, he delirious the peoples, he delirious the history and the geography, well for example, to have been completely comfort at 68, it that is to say, having brought there, it seems a bit of erre-saint, of which all this is contained, malseurs, delusions that occur, people, we have seen that it is delirious. If I get delirious, it's about reading about my child, we have it too, about my little private affair. We rave about cosmic delirium, we rave about the end of the moment, we rave about particles, about electrons, but not about pas-pamant, of course. Gilles de l'oeuvre, Bobbin Nuff. One second, I'm serious. Like, you can go out a little bit. There, when you want to go. Precisely, concerning this collective arrangement, of desire, I am thinking of certain misinterpretations, I remember that 20 years ago, in the 1972s, at the faculty, there were people who put into practice this desire, it rather gives rise to collective loves, it was not very well understood. And I, I would like, or even more precisely, because there were a lot of crazy things before the scene, like you started from a schizo-analysis to fight psychoanalysis, everyone thought that it was was good enough to be mad, to be schizo. Then, one saw of number one true similar per thousand students. And I would like you to tell me, like that, some funny or less funny stories of his misinterpretations about desire. But the misinterpretations, I rather applauded the dirafs-stretois, the misinterpretations tinted in two things. There were two cases, it will come from elsewhere, even. There were those who thought that desire was spontaneity. That's good, there were always spontaneous movements, spontaneity. The spontaneous words, the famous ones. And then the others who thought that desire was a party. So, for us, it was the anillotre, but that didn't matter much, because... Anyway, there were agencies for them to do, there were things that... Even the crowds, crowds, crowds, there were so many of all kinds. That was part of what was happening to oneself there, to going to that one. But the crowds was... They had their discipline, they had their misguided friend. They did their discou, they did their interventions, and also, they train their agencies. They had their agencies, but they deal with them very well in an arrangement. They were... They had some kind of Russian, understanding, great possessions, crowds, and so on. But at the level of theory, practically, it was a decent agency. He was getting... They were getting loose. Theoretically, the nonsense, you're told, marouille, desire, is spontaneity. So we were called, the spontaneists, or else it's party time. But that wasn't it. That's you... The philosophy of idudesia, that consists in a bark to red years. But don't get psychologized, never interpret, experiment with agencies for years. Look for years agencies that suit you, that everyone is looking for. So what the hell are you doing years ago? Me, I would say an arrangement for me. And... Félic, that bothered you... It's not that they thought otherwise, because... It was perhaps my astegages, it's not for me. The matiadric, there were four components of agencies. If you want, I am... Finally, very big, that there is not a four more toxic. But, an assemblage, that will send to states of affairs. Let everyone find the state of affairs which suits him somewhat. So, later on, for me, I meet such cafes, I meet such cafes, the people who are at such cafes, and so on. That is a state of affairs. In terms of layout, edonsées. Of the types of edonses, the each styles, it has certain saddlebags to speak of. He's... Okay, so that's archoal. In the café, for example, there are friends, and then there are some badières to talk to friends. It's not... Chacca makes a style sound. Oh, I say there are cafes. But it also goes for a whole other thing. So, an assemblage, that one brings about states of affairs, and edonseas... styles of elanciation. For example, it's really... It's very interesting. History is the effect of 50, isn't there such new type of slender? For example, in the Russian Revolution, the edonsies, the Ledidist type, when did they not see as in what forms... In 68, when did they not see the first edonsées, said of 68, it is very, very complex. Finally, any agency, it applies styles of elanciation. And then it involves territories. Each has its territory, there are territories. Even when we are in a room, we choose our territory. I give a piece that I do not know. I am looking for the territory, that is to say the place where I will feel the organic in the room. And then there are processes, which must be called deterritorialization. That is to say the baguelle in time goes out of the territory, in the kind of good. I would say that the arrangement satisfies these four dimensions. States of things, impulses, territories, territorial movements, and it is in this that desire flows. So... It mustn't start from the fact that there are really responsible people who have apprehended drugs. We have them too literally, the Caribbean says, because that's not a problem, I would say, it's not like... Cato who encourages young people to do stupid things. We are always responsible for it. But what were the effects of Antille said? Me, I've always tried to make it work, well... Anyway, I never believe, it's good, it's my aneur. I've never been clever, that's the thing. I never told a student, drugs, you, your reason. I always did what I could to get them out of trouble. Because I'm too sensitive to the tiniest thing that suddenly makes it sound, that suddenly makes someone fall into a state of investigation, that drinks very well. There, you, I've never been able to in red times, I who do, I don't like computers. But I think you have to be very careful about the weight where it can go. Who drinks, who takes drugs, who does what is worth. We're not cops, we're not an idea, I'm not supposed to prevent them or... But do everything so that they don't turn into a state of oc. So, when there is a risk, that, I'm not... I'm not very much someone who takes drugs, and someone who takes drugs like this, who takes drugs, I don't I don't know, the savage in such a way, that I tell myself that's it, he's going to crack. I'm not especially a young guy, you talk about people, I'm not into the young who cracks. It's not supporting, that. A cracking old man, who's so... Well, he's seen his life. But someone young who cracks with caution, it's possible, me too, because that's where you are. So, I've always been torn between the possibility of proving someone wrong, and there, the absolute desire, where the absolute refusal, that they turn to the state of the oc. Well there too, it's a parade base, you know. I can't say that there are principles, we feel like we can shock. We try, it's true that the role of people, to oneself there, is to try to save the little gloves, as much as we can. And saving them doesn't mean we're going to get the law taken, it means preventing them from becoming lakes. That's all I want. No, but it was about the effects, the effects of Antillia, because we had people at the UN. That's it, it was prevented. Good, sin, that it turns there, that to oneself there, what is or that a guy who develops, finally, a great beginning of what they offered said, either in tape condition, that we don't put him in a repressive hospital, all that ... he stops, let him stop... Because it was all the same a revolutionary book insofar as it seemed for the enemies to follow the little channelers as an apology for permissiveness and to say that... It's all the solid edicts, you have this, this book has never... That is to say when you read this book, this book has always marked a caution, it seemed that it is very low. No, become... There, the sound, that's you... No, don't become lakes. When we are imposed, we know this opposite step, the process that offered us to... To the type of hospital. And for us, the terror was to produce a hospital creature. It's not all that. And I would almost say... Selling the kinds of values of the journey of what we called, of what we have the antipsis, which caught up with the journey to the process that offered us access to it... It was a way to avoid warding off the production of hospital lakes. That is to say the production of fresh skits. The manufacture of fresh skits, right? Do you think to end the hype Antille that this book is still effects now? Yes, because... That's a good book. It's a good book, not if there's a conception of the conception in my opinion. This is the only case where there was a conception of concernostics. I say, on the two points, where the three points. The multiplicities of concern, delirium as world delirium and not family delirium, cosmic delirium, racial delirium, tribal delirium. That is good. And the concern as a machine, as a musine and not as a theatre. I have nothing to change, the C3 points. And in my opinion, remains absolutely new, because the whole psychoanalysis is reconstituted, and that gives... So, for me, I hope that there is a book that we will rediscover. Maybe, maybe, I don't pray that we rediscover it.
