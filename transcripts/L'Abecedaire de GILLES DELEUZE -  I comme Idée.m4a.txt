So are we in case? No, we're at... Ah wall yes! So he, it's like... he as an idea. So it's more the idea of the tenition that we come from bouquets, that you come from bouquets. It is first of all that more than drawing up an inventory of theories, you have always been passionate about the ideas of philosophers, as you have just shown, nothing soft. For the ideas of thinkers in the cinema, that is to say the directors on stage, for the ideas of artists in painting. Always to explanations and comments you preferred the idea. Yours is that of others. Why for you does the idea preside over everything? There it is, it's true, the idea in the sense of care, the employment that is no longer... it's no longer a question of Platos, the idea in the sense of care, all the creative activities. Very is to have an idea. More it is very difficult to have an idea, people who live and who are not at all contemptible for that, they live their whole life without having an idea. Before an idea, it's around domains. There are no areas where there is no need to have ideas. But it's rare, it's still a party to have an idea. It doesn't happen every day. I have a shepherd and he has no less ideas than a philosopher. It's just not the same kind of idea. We would have to ask like that, if we reflect on the different activities of man, under what force does the idea represent in such and such a case. In philosophy, at least, we have just seen. The idea in philosophy is presented in the form of a concept and there is creation of the concept. There is no overdraft of concept. There are as many creations in a philosophy as in a painting, as in a musical work. But the others, the others, they have ideas, they just hit what is called a manteur en scene. It's important, there are a lot of performers out there who have never had a clue. But ideas are very obsessive. It's like things that go, that come, and then that take various forms, if they are worth it, they are condescending to say things very like that. Near that I think of a height of cinema like minelle Lille. We can say, but in all his work there is not in all that you cannot turn around, but think that if the easy ones, here is someone who wonders, it seems to me, what is is that right? People dream. They dream. We talked a lot about that, it's platitude, they dream. People dream, certainly. But Minelle asks him a very strange question, which has not been to him to my knowledge. What the hell got caught up in someone's dream? And it goes from the comic, to the tragic, to the bomminable? What does it mean, for example, to be caught up in a young girl's dream? Well, they can come out of it on TV, get caught up in someone's dream, get caught up in it's someone's dream. Maybe it's the rheur at the étapure. Sometimes, minelle Lille, then, in a dream, it will mean being caught in the nightmare of war. And that gives the admirable, the chivaliers of the poquette, where he does not consider war as war. It would not be minelle Lille, he considers the war as a great nightmare. What's that gonna say, caught in a nightmare? What's it going to mean to be caught in the girl's dream? And that makes musicals. And that makes faples musicals, where it's fresh by a stere, I think, where I read that she says, I don't know, and escapes, where we grease you, where we black area, I don't know what, so that's it, he caught in someone's dream, it's true. It's true, that's an idea. In short, and yet, it's not a concept, but she knows it, if he didn't think of a concept, he would be doing philosophy, he's making films. The reminders that it is almost necessary to distinguish three kinds of hours, three dimensions, three things, so strongly that it mixes everything. There is, we should talk about one, and that, I think there is still it is my future work, there that I explain. That's what I would really like to do. Now, I'm going to take care of that, he was trying to be clear, there, there are concepts. Concepts which are really ahead of philosophy, and then there are what we might call percepts. Who has that, it's the domain of art, the percepts. Percepts, so what are percepts? I believe that an artist is someone who creates percepts. So why used in my bizarre, percepts, everything rather perception, precisely, is that percepts are not perceptions. You would say to put it, what does a man of letters, a writer, a novelist want, there. I believe that he wants to succeed in constructing sets of perception, of sensation, which occurs to those who experience them. Exceeding a percept. A percept is a set of percepts and sensations that occur to those who experience them. I take examples. There are stage rate pages which describes, good, which describes as a painter, there is a barely book, which describes or check-off. From the number to handle, which describes the heat in the stadium. So it's all a complex sense to sure. We pass, there are certain visual and auditory senses, there is almost a stative, something in the process of the mouth, I find that good. So, tell me, there is a work school. Try to give this complex meaning to sure, radical independence, not from whoever was proving them. Tolstoy also describes atmospheres. Must be clear in the large pages of Faults-Tlaire, if you could give up the very large ones. They get to that. There will be some who almost said it and whom I really like, I don't think very well known in France, America, it's Thomas Wolf. Thomas Wolf, he says in his news, he says here, someone is going out in the morning. And he smells of fresh air. A smell comes to him, from a door-cow of pagrillet, but there is a complex meaning to sure, to nuts at the step in the sky, there is a complex meaning to sure. What happens when he dies, the one who proves them, or when he does something else? What becomes of it? That's good, it seems to me a bit like the question of art. Art gives an answer to that. To give a duration or an eternity, this complex meaning to sure, which most grasped, as being experienced by someone, or at the very least which is going to be grasped, as being experienced by a character in a novel, that is, say by a fictional character. This is what generates fiction. And what to do to graze? I think he doesn't just do that, but grazes gives consistency to perceptions. It tore perceptions from percepts. There is a phrase of the season that touches me more than anything. He says impressionism? Yes, a shepherd doesn't do anything else. He will do a lot to me, we can already say that the Impressionists, he completely distorts perception. We can say that we infiltrate the offices to the letter. In a way, it will work. It is a habit of thinking which is new. It's people who aren't used to thinking like that. It will force. An impercept of that hurts, in a way, it hurts the nerves. We can say that the impressionists, they rave about the percept. But now these donkeys, there is a word about these donkeys, it opens so beautifully, it says something that lasting impressionism provides. It does not yet have the reason for steps that are independences. If it slips, it doesn't make it lasting and only him, new methods are needed to take on lasting impressionism. It does not simply mean that the painting is more conserved. It means that the percept acquires an even greater autonomy. New techniques will be needed and reports will be needed. And then there would be a third thing, I believe very much, and most of all, it's what should be called the affects. So of course, there is no piercing without affects, affects them, it's not all the same, I was trying to define the percept as a set of perception and sensation of good independent of the one who proves them. For me, affects and becomings are becomings which overflow the one who passes through them, which exceeds the forces of the one who passes through them. It's an affect. I took over what music would not be the great creator of affects. Wouldn't that lead us into powers that hold us back that which makes us good? It's possible, but all I'm saying is that the three sounds are related anyway. If you take a philosophical concept, it's more a matter of accents. If you take a philosophical concept, it's true that a concept makes things see. He shows things. In this way, the philosophies are all the same on the seeing side, but still of those who love me, which will show us. He was one of the more showy philosophies than they are. Un íd, he shows things. And also, it's spears of fantastic affects. So at that point, you really have to talk. It turns out all on the mind. There is a music of these philosophies. And with this moment, we saw the music say it makes you see very strange things. Our would even sometimes be colors, it shows colors that exist by ordelle, ordelle music. And the percepts too, all of that is very much linked. And I will dream of a kind of circulation, the ades in others, of philosophical concepts, of pictorial perceptions, of musical affects. And it's no wonder there are reasons. If an addiction, it's works of... They're works of completely different genres, but they don't know how to penetrate each other. So, these ideas of painters, artists and philosophers, which are the opposite of having ideas, but which are an idea of perception, an idea of affection, an idea of reason. Why you ? Finally, in life, you can see a movie, or read a book, where there is no idea. And you, it hurts you to a point. It does not interest you. I find it uninteresting. There's absolutely no point in you watching something that can be fun, or reading something that can be entertaining, if there isn't that idea. If there is no idea. In the sense that I come to define an idea, I find it hard to see that this would be possible. If you showed me a painting where there is no percept, where there is a cow which is represented, which is more on the seeming arm, but where there is no cow percept, where she does not is not raised to the state of perception. If you want to hear music where there is no affect, ultimately, I even see because it can mean. If you want to drag me into a film, yes, it's if you want to tell yourself an idiotic philosophy book, I don't see what pleasure, if not bad blood pleasure, one can have there. But it wasn't a silly philosophy book, it could be a humorous book. A humorous book, down on the, and the dish says, maybe. I don't know, I was spending everything on the humorous pelie, I had no one to make anyone more, that in any case, so I'm very sensitive to humor, I find it very vendroule, I like less comics on TV, yes. It is indeed he, that there is certainly an idea. It's an idea, yes. Indeed, even in the Thumbnaise, obviously the great American birlesses, they have ideas. And ideas. And you, that is to say, you arrive at your silk to finish with a more personal question, at your table without any idea of what you are going to do, that is to say, you do not have the idea, how does it go? No, if I don't have the idea that I'm not going to have at your table, what happens to me is that the idea isn't developed, it's that the idea escapes me, it's that the idea is there, it's the holes, and all that, that, I have experienced the horror of all that. Yes, it's not all that, yes. Since ideas do not exist, everything is done, to make them, at a call, however, there are terrible times, that is to say there are times when literally, we hope and I won't be able, yes. Yes, that, yes. It's the expression, the idea that makes it too lacking, is it both? A possible to distinguish that. Do I have the idea that I can't express it? Or do I not have WLID, in my opinion, it was so similar, if I can't express it, I have no idea. Yes, mum, you've died, dead that other idea, because she's not going to have a blank one, just an idea. There are things that come from this, from getting it, and it comes from various backgrounds, an idea. If one end is missing, it is unusable.
