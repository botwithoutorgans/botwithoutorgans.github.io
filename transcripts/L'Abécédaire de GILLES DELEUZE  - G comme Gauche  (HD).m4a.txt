Where am I from? From where I have. It will take. And then there, it's not the demon point that constitutes your charm, because it speaks to it of the very serious thing, it's your apartment, that's the left. It's the art of bringing it to life, and I'm very, very happy. So, as we have seen, you are here from a right-wing and elaboration middle-class family which is rather what is called a left-wing group, well, at least quickly. First of all, many of your friends, many of you who were philosophy students, on the PC or are very much linked to the PC, on the release. To all they have passed, yes, what is it? I believe. I believe, I'm not sure. All of them passed. There, how did you kill and chaper? It is for such good complicated, to them, all the friends pass to the PC. Me, what will prevent it? It's because I think I was very hardworking. And that I didn't have the meetings. That, I never liked. Meetings talk endlessly. All that, I never supported. So, all the same, being from the PC at home, it was meetings, it's him all the time. It was the time, even, Jers, once, the landmark, it was the attendants of the Stockholm call. All that, he spent a long time, but when they had a talent and gold, he spent my days of effort getting the shovel of Stockholm signed, by a priest, by a door-what. They were walking around with the Stockholm shovel. I don't even know anymore that it was the Stockholm eupel. But it recovered. And finally, all of a generation of comedy, here, there, I had problems. I had told of hearing stories binds. I knew a lot of comedy historian, full of talent. And if they did the brace, it would be much more important for the comedian party, which at least would have work at a good price than the used ones had signed the shovel of Stockholm, the shovel of the pîne on the shovel, or what is not what. And I had no desire. I wasn't a talker, I won't talk, and so, getting the Stockholm shovel to sign, that bit into the balance sheet from a state of panicky shyness. I hadn't had anyone sign anything. In addition, I had to sell them, the humanities, all that, it's for very good reasons. I don't know if I didn't even pose for myself, I had no desire to join the party. We came out close to their engagement. From the party, no, it's a sabage to disconcert me. This is also what will be found in the member. Discussions about Stalin, all that, what we recently discovered about the horrors of Stalin, well, everyone in the country knows it. I will say them all the time. That revolutions go wrong. It doesn't matter to me, not that, finally. Who we miss. When the new philosophers discovered that revolutions go wrong. You really have to be a bit stupid. They discovered that with Stalin. Then the way was open. Everyone discovered it. For example, the proposal is to abandon the revolution to Gériarée, from Atiède to Basel to turn not so antiré on the students. Finally, who ever believed that revolutions turn out well. Who said, they saw, we well the English, so they weren't about to make revolutions. It is absolutely false. But all that currently, in town, in such a mystification, the English have made a revolution. They killed their king, etc. Yeah, yes. And what did they have, like her? And what is English romanticism? It is the ambitation on the failures of the revolution. They did not hear that UXMAN to reflect on the failures of the Stalinist revolution. He loves it. And Americans never have two. But the Americans failed in their revolution. At least as much if donpire as the Polsheviks. It will not hurt Americans when they, even before the Pandemic War, present themselves as a better than a new nation. They passed the nations. Exactly, as Max said, from the proletarian, they overtook the nations. The nations ended. They bring the new people. They are making the real revolution. And just as the Maxists counter on universal proletarianization, Americans count on universal emigration. They are the two fans of the class struggle. It is absolutely revolutionary. This is Jefferson's America. It's TOROS' America and it's Melville's America. I did his, TOROS, Melville, all that stuff. It is revolutionary America that announces the new man. Exactly, as the Bolshevik revolution heralds the new man. She screwed up all the fair revolutions, everyone knows it. We pretend to rediscover it the madwoman of the Biles. So everyone laughs about it, it's current revisionism. There is a furait who discovers that the French revolution was not so good. There is okay. Yes, she was free too and everyone knows it. The French Revolution, it gave Napoleon. We make discoveries that are less exciting because of their novelty. The English revolution, it gave cromboelle. The American Revolution, she gave co-op. She gave frependie and she gave rigane. It's not. It doesn't seem so much more fabulous. So, I say to your confusion that revolutions fail, that revolutions turn out badly. But that never stopped people. Nor does it prevent people from becoming revolutionaries. We mix absolutely different things. Situations in which, the only way out for man is to become revolutionary. Again, we talk about it from the beginning, finally. It is the confusion of becoming eglistory. And if people become revolutionaries, yes, it is this confusion of historians. Historians, it is in parliament the future of the revolution, the future of revolutions. But that's not the question at all. So he can always go back too, to show that if the future was bad, it's because the bad was already at the beginning. But the problem we were discussing, how is it that people become revolutionaries? And that, fortunately, the historians prevent it, one cannot. It is obvious that South Africans are caught up in a revolutionary process. The Palestinians are caught up in a revolutionary process of becoming. If someone tells me afterwards, at Mévouveré, when they have made plans, if their revolution succeeds, things will turn out badly. It's true, at first they won't be the same. These will not be the same kind of problems at all. And then, well, it creates a new situation. Again, there will be revolutionary devils that are triggered. Doing it with men is in situations of tyranny, of oppression, it is effectively, they become revolutionaries there because there is nothing else to do. When we are told afterwards, it all goes wrong, we are not talking about the same thing. It is as if we are speaking two absolutely different languages. The future of history is the current future of people, it's not the same thing. And this respect for human rights, which is so fashionable today, is not becoming revolutionary, it's the opposite. And this respect for human rights, it's really, we want to become present under the proposals, to the gods, it's... It's so much part of this thought of this soft thought of the poor period we were talking about. It's pure abstraction. Human rights, but what are they? It's pure abstraction, it's empty. This is exactly what was said earlier for the deci, that is to say for the deci. The decision does not consist in erecting an object, in saying that I desire this. One does not desire, for example, freedom, etc. It's... it's zero. We open up in situations. I take the current example of Arbenia. He's all...all...reincentive. What is the situation? Get it, are you okay? Will correct, but if we don't correct, it doesn't change much. There is this clave time in another Soviet Republic. There is this median claveur time. There is an Arbenian Republic, there is an enclave. It's a situation. The first thing. There is this bassacre, only Turks, semblances, species of Turks, the quarter. As far as we're concerned, I guess that's it, my coronation of Iain's armies once again. In the enclave, the armies of Iain are reconsidering. In their Republic, I suppose to Correct all my errors and there you sink into the ground. We would be in the Marquit de Sade, to go through the worst for you. The worst ordeals of the désom, and hardly Isarie, there, sheltered, it is nature that gets involved. I say, we say human rights. These are speeches for the intellectual, and for the high-god intellectual, and for the intellectual who has no idea. First, I notice that always these declarations on human rights, they are never made on people who stop. Nian armed societies, Nian army communities, etc. Because for them, the problem is not human rights. It's what ? What have we done? When I said the irres, it's always through agencies. There you have it, an arrangement. What is possible to remove Stonclan or to make this enclave livable? What does Stonclan give? It was a question of territory. It's not a human rights issue. It's land organization. What are they going to assume Gordnacht heats up and get out of these situations? How is he going to ensure that he is not Stonclan, that Averbédienne delivered the role to the Ture that Benatze up around? It's not a question. I would say, it's not a human rights issue. It's not a question of justice. It is a matter of case law. All amominations that subillomes are cases. They're not abstract rights dismantlers. These are horrible cases. It seems to me that it is a little overstated, but it is the situations of jurisprudence. The Armenian problem, typically what I will be called, an extremely complex game-exprudence problem, what to do to save the Armenians and even the Armenians to save themselves from this crazy telecent situation. Or what's more, this earthquake gets into it. Earthquake, good, which also has its reasons, the constructions which were not good, which were not done, that twenty-twenty, etc. All of that is case law. Agin for freedom tell me air revolution. And it is done in case law, when you go to justice. Justice does not exist, human rights do not exist. What concerns jurisprudence, that is the advance of the law. So, those who are content to recall human rights and remain human rights, but they are stupid. It's about creating, it's about enforcing human rights. It is a question of advancing case law. Or for everyone, this will no longer be possible. It's very different. I'm taking an example that I really like because it's the only way to make people understand, because it's that case law is something that will no longer be possible. And I understood nothing. Finally, by all that, I understood not very well. I would like to call the time when the smoke in the taxis. Before the smoke there. There was a time when we weren't allowed to smoke anymore. The first taxi drivers who banned smoking, it made noise because there were smokers. In any case, I have always been passionate about case law. By law, that's what got me... I wouldn't have done law, but precisely not human rights. I will make case law. Because that's life. That means there is no human right. There is life. There are rights in life. It's only one per case. And There you go. So taxis. There's a guy who doesn't want to be banned from smoking in a taxi, a taxi lawsuit. I did very well because there, I had taken care of having the grounds of judgment. The taxi was condemned. Today, no way. There would be the same trial. It would not condemn the taxi. It would be the man who would be condemned. But at first the taxi was doomed. Under what expectation, that when one who took a taxi, he was locatère. So the taxi user has been assimilated to the locator. The tenant has the right to smoke with us. He has the right of use and support. It's as if he was doing rentals. It's like he's going to take. He has been remapped. You're not going to smoke me in your house. If I am a tenant, I can smoke at home. So the taxi has been assimilated to a wheeled apartment. So is the use locatere? Ten to later. That is absolutely universalized. There are hardly any more taxis. You can smoke at number what. The taxi is no longer assimilated to an apartment rental. It is assimilated to a public service. In a public service, we have the right to ban smoking. It's all case law. It's not about 3 this or that. It is about situation and changing situation. And to fight for freedom is really to make jurisprudence. There the example of Armenia will attack me the typical one. Human rights. You have a bit that human rights, what does that mean? It means to the Turks whose right to sacred the Armenians to me. The Turks whose right to crowned me the Armenians. Then we moved on with that. It's really stupid. Or else I think it was really so much hypothites. There all alone thinks the rights of man. It's zero philosophically, it's zero. And the creation of law is not declarations. Creation in law is jurisprudence. There is that it exists. So fight for jurisprudence. We are going to come back to two things that are related to man. That's what's on the left. It's very straight. I there the work, Bobin 17 and last in principle of the day. Yes. It is well considered. So let's take the question again. We were this philosophy of human rights. But is respected by all for human rights. Now it's like a renegade of my 68s. A renegade of my 68s and a renegade of Marxism. So you didn't have to repudiate Marx since you weren't a communist. You can still use it. It's still a reference for you. And my 68, you're one of the last people there. She is voked 68 and she does not want to say that it was zero, a châu and that everyone has changed. I would like you to tell me a little more about my 68. And all that, now you are severe in 10 years. I am a jerk. There is a lot of people. There are only around us and our friends. I know very few... There is no Renéka. But it's I have a friend. Yes, but there are many. Let him make no renunciation of it. It's almost understood. There, the answer is quite simple. Either in 18, it is the truss of the Dove-Lig. We sometimes wanted to see the Ren of the imagination. It is absolutely not imaginary. It's a whiff of reality at the stage. It's Rene. That's the whole thing. The Reneka arrives. People including not. They don't tell themselves what it is. Real people, finally. People in their reality. It was prodigious. And how about you like in their reality? Well, it's the Dove-Lig. So there could be bad fates. All that. That the hesi historian is not well understood. It's forced because I believe so much in the difference between history and the Dove-Lig. It has a revolutionary Dove-Lig. Without a future of revolution. So we can always laugh. We don't care once it's over. It was phenomena of pure becoming that took people. Even animal becomings, even becomings in French, even becoming women of men, becoming men of women, all of them. It is this very particular obedience around which we have been turning since the beginning of our questions. This is what has become for me. In any case, it is the intrusion of becoming. And you, did you really become a revolutionary at that time? Live revolutionary. Yes, just your smile makes you think it's not his motor skills, tell me sooner. But what is left? It's more the story of telling you. I asked you the question between. It's between your civility, left-wing men who want to, and all that. And therefore become a revolutionary as you have a man on the left, how you manage. And what is left for you? Yes. Me, I'll tell you, I don't think there is a left-wing government. For that, there also, one should not be astonished the government which reteuré of government of left. And what is a leftist government? It is not that there is no difference in governments. And there is at best what we can hope for, it is a government favorable to certain demands, or reclaves of the left. But a government of the left is not negligee because the left is not to make a government. Me, if we said how to define, she of the left or how to define the left, I would say in two ways. There are two ways. And there too, it is fully. It is, first of all, a matter of perception. There is a matter of perception. The matter of perception is this. It is, not being on the left, what is it? Not being on the left is a bit like a postal address. From sister, the street where you are, the city, the country, the other countries further and further. We start with ourselves. Insofar as we are privileged, in ladies, a rich country, we tell ourselves how to make the situation last. We are coming who has dangers. It won't last all that. It's too demon that... But how to make it last? So we say where? There, the Chinese, they will make his nuts better. But how do you make Europe of Europe still appeal to you? Edegou is the opposite. It is to perceive, so it is said that the Japanese perceive like that. They don't perceive like us. They first perceive the turn-turn. So he would tell the world. The continent putting Europe, France, etc., etc., rue de Biserde, me. It is a phenomenon of perception. First you see the horizon. We perceive on the horizon. It's not out of generosity. Yes, but just that, you're not objecting by... It's not a reason. By there, they are on the left, by their direction, of postal address, they are on the left. First you see the horizon. And you know it can't last. It's not possible. It's a billion people who are coming to an end. It could last another 100 years on these streets. You mustn't tease. It is absolute justice. It's not moral. It is beyond perception even. If we start with the beautiful, with these left bleeds, by knowing, and in a certain way, called from his views, and considered that these are the problems to be solved. And it is not simply, we must reduce the birth rate. Because that is a way of keeping the privileges of Europe. It's not that. It's really about finding arrangements, finding agencies, mounting them. So indeed, the problems of tirs-mands, to be on the left, is to know that the problems of tirs-mands are closer to us, than the problems of our neighborhood. It's really a matter of perception. It's not a question of belame, all that. And no, that's having a left for me. And second, a leftist is to be by nature or rather to become, it's a problem of becoming, of passing here, of becoming a minority. That is to say that the left is never in the majority among the left. And for a very simple reason, it's that the majority is something that supposes, even when we vote, it's not simply the greatest number that votes for such a thing. The majority, it supposes a stallion. In the West, the standard of presuming any majority is an adult man, Marle, a citizen of the cities. Rapoulès, our joy, are things like that. It's perfect yes, that's the stallion. So we will have the majority by matur, the one who has so much or the whole, such a mother will carry out this stallion. That is to say the sensible image of the adult man, Marle, citizen of the cities. So that at the limit, I can say the majority is never nobody. It's never nobody, it's an empty stallion. Simply several people, a maximum of people on start in this empty stall. But in itself, the standard is empty. The man, mom, etc. Women will count and will intervene in the majority or in secondary minorities, according to the engro, not when not tired of going. But besides that, what is there? There are all becomings that are minority becomings. Women are not a given, they are not women by maturity. Women have a becoming woman. Suddenly, if women are going to become women, men too, they have to become women. Earlier we were talking about animal becomings. The children, they have a becoming child. They are not children by maturity. All these becomings there, that's the limit. Men are not going to become men, it's hard. Ah well no, he is a majority stallion. It's empty. Man has me as an adult, he doesn't have a future. They can become women, they are there, they engage minority prostetus. The left is all of the prostétus but to become a minority. So I can say literally, the majority is nobody, the minority is everyone. That's it, there are two lefts. It is knowing that the minority is everyone. And that's where it is, it's facts, even becoming. That's why all the thinkers who are, they had this case in democracy of doubts about what we call elections. It was the well-known good thing.
