So is it this style? Oh no, well there. So, what is Andiologue's style? You say it's the property of those who are said to have no style. I think you say it about Balsac, I seem to remember. So what is a style? Ah well, it's not a small question, are you ok? No, that's why it's asked so quickly. Yeah, and what do you see? I tell myself this. To understand what a style is, one must above all know nothing of linguistics. Linguistics has done a lot of harm. Why does she hurt so much? Because there is opposition. There, Foucault, it will be said very well. There is an opposition, it is even their complementarity, between linguistics and literature. Against the mention of that, it doesn't count at all. For linguistics, a language is always a system in equilibrium. So, of which we can make the science. And the rest, the variations, they are put on the side, not of language, but of speech. When we write, we know well that a language is in fact a system, physicists would say, a system by nature far from equilibrium. It is a system in perpetual equilibrium. So there is no difference, or there is no difference in level between the angue words, but the language is made of all kinds of currents and therogens in balances with each other . So what is the style of a great author. Personally, I believe that style, there are two things in a style. You see, there, I answer clearly. Claire is fast, a big shame, it's too high. A style, it seems to me, consists of two things. We subject the language in which we spoke, we write. You put your tongue through some treatment. Not an artificial, voluntary treatment, etc., it is a treatment that mobilizes everything. The will of the author, but also his desires, his desires, his series. It is necessary, it is necessary. Finally, to submit to the language a treatment, its tactic, original. It can be, then, but your, we find the theme of the animal, it can make the tongue wail. I mean not babble yourself, make the tongue babble. Or what is not the same thing, stammering the tongue, for examples of great stylists. Derrasime Luca Poet, I say basically, he makes yawn, not his own word, he makes the language yawn. Pégui, it's curious people, because pégui has a certain personality, a certain type, we forget that above all and, like all great artists, he's a complex madman. No one has ever written like pegui, no one will ever write like pegui again. It is part of the great styles of the French language, that is to say of the great creatures of the French language. What makes him, you can't say he's a beagle? It makes the sentence grow in the middle, it's fantastic. Instead of sweating sentences, it repeats the same sentence with an addition in the middle of the sentence. Which in turn will engender another tradition in the sentence, etc. It is a process of proliferating the sentence from the middle, by insertion. It's a great disgust, it's a great style. So that's the first aspect. Putting the tongue through treatment, but incredible treatment. That's why a great style is not a preservation of syntax. It is a syntax creator. And I do not come out of the post so beautiful formula. Chedoves are always written in some sort of foreign language. A style is someone who creates a foreign language in his language. It's true of s'éline, it's true of pégui, it's true of... That's what you recognize as a stylist. And secondly, along with the first aspect, namely, the syntax is subjected to a contentious, but necessary distorting treatment. Which constitutes like a foreign language in the language in which one writes, at the same time, the second prince is only by the same, or this time, everything engages him, up to a kind of limit. The limit that, the edge that separates from the music, a kind of music is produced. If we succeeded in things there, and if there is a need to do so, it's a style, that's the égan styleiste. And it's true of everyone at the same time, we're also going to pose a foreign language in language and bring all language to a kind of musical limit. That's to see a style. And you, do you think you have a style? Wow Fidi. But I have a month, I can say, that he has changed from the first books now. He is like Saint-Vérifilm. And generally, we are going towards more and more without burning. But the darker and darker does not mean the less complex. I think of the administration of cold style, it's Keroak. Keroak at the end, Keroak, it's a Japanese line. It's really a Japanese design, a pure Japanese line, his style. That, that we had a sobriety, but which then implies a creation, really the creation of a foreign language in the language, all the more so, yes. So, a style, I'm thinking of Selino too, it's very very very hard, when people still say to Selino, you have introduced the spoken language into the written language, which was already stupidity. In fact, it takes quite a treatment written in the language. It is necessary to create a foreign language in the language and to hold in writing the equivalent of speaking. He has too much polt to speak in the language, it's stupidity. But when you compliment him on that, it's very good that he's at... and that he's so far from what would like. And that's going to be in the second novel, in Mora Crédit, that's it. In Mora Credit, that he will approach. But when Mora Credit is told, he must be changing, but he knows again that he is very, very far from what he wants. And what he wants, he's going to get it with Gignal's Band, where we've made the language and pushed it to such a limit that it's all music project. It's more a treatment of the language that makes the anguette dangerex, it's all the language pushed to a musical limit. While a style, by nature, changes, and sabaritation. And that's when we say to him, to this repetitive music with... Yes, except that Pégu is a greater stylist. You didn't answer my perfilie, do you think you have a style? I would like, to what I say, I would like, I have the feeling, if we already say to be a styleist, we have to live the problem of style, I can answer more modestly, if it is a style, for me, I screw him, yes. I had the flu, telling myself the style, we'll see later. I know very well that I won't get the movement of the concepts that I want, if it doesn't go through the style. And the need to compete it, I know close, we redo the same page 10 times. 8. So style is like a necessity of composition, of what you're writing, and composition intervenes in a very primordial way. There, I believe that you are completely right, it is something else that you say there. Is the composition of a book already done in style? There, I believe that absolutely, yes. The composition of a book is one thing... it is decided beforehand, it is done at the same time as the book is being made. For example, in books that... in what I've done, if I dare invoke that, there are books that seem composed to me. I have always attached importance to the composition itself. I am thinking, for example, of a book called Logique du Sense, which is composed by series. It's really a kind of serial composition for me. And then, il plato, platoes being things. But, for me, it's two almost musical compositions. Yes. A composition is an element of the fundamental style. Yes. And in your expression, to use a sentence you said earlier, do you... Now, today, you are closer to what you wanted to do, than 20 years, or it doesn't happen like that, or it's... You have the same thing I do, I feel like I'm getting closer. In what is not part of the game, in what is not yet done, I have the feeling that I am approaching, that I am holding something, that I am looking for and that I had not found. Yes. And style isn't just about air, you're sensitive in all areas. For example, you live with faded elegance, and your friend Jean-Pierre is very elegant. If you are very sensitive to this elegance. Yes, there, I like that to overtake by them. I would like to be very elegant, but I know well that I am not. But elegance for me is one thing... Even perceiving it, I mean, there is already an elegance which consists in perceiving what elegance is, this one, there are people who pass by. And for whom, for example, what is called elegance is not elegance at all. So, a certain seizure of elegance, there is already part of elegance, that strikes me a lot. It's also a field, it's like everything, it can be learned. You have to be a little gifted, it has to be learned. Why are you telling me this ? For style, who is from all areas? Ah, the genre, well yes, of course, but in fact, it weighs on you, it's still not too late. Which is maybe what it takes. No no. Is it true? I don't know, it's just... I have the feeling, it's more, it doesn't just depend on the elegance, that there's one thing that I admire a lot, but this that's important in the world, that's all my elegance. So, I was going to say, the dance of elegance, vulgarity too, it is my elegance. It's more that, if it matters to me. It is the emission of signs. So, no doubt that's why I was loved, that I still love proust so much, worldliness, worldliness, worldly relations, these are emissions of fantastic signs. What is called a blunder is a misunderstanding in a sign. You know, signs that people don't understand. So, that's... But worldliness, as the medium of coldness of signs, empty, absolutely empty, no interest in these signs. But that is the avoidance of the nature of forgiveness. It joins the animal members, because the animal members too. It's fantastic sign shows. The animals and the mondas are the masters of the signs. Besides, you don't go out much, but you've always been more sensitive to the evening and worldly than any sensation we experience viale. Ah, well yes, because... At least the constituent circles don't argue. They spent vulgarity there. And the conversation is absolutely in lightness, that is to say in evocation, which would be really fast, in conversational speed, whatever you have. Here too, these are very interesting sign emissions.
