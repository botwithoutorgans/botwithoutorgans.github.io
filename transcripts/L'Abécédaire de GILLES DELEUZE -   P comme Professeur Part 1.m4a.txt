So Pé is a teacher. Today you are 64 years old and for almost 40 years who was a teacher. First smoothed then at university and therefore this year the first or weeks are to be considered without classes. First, do the courses end? Because you also said that you did the lessons with passion. Do you miss not going to class today? So during the blow you don't feel the blow during the blow. No it's fine. It's true that it was my life in France. It was a part of my life, a very important part of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed teaching. But when the art came, it was a joy. Because I had less desire to teach. The question of courses is very simple. I think the courses are like... There are equivalents in other fields. But a course is something that requires a lot of preparation. I mean it fits the, almost the recipe for a lot of activities. If you want 5 minutes, 10 minutes at best of inspiration, you have to prepare a lot, a lot, a lot. To have that moment. If we haven't returned. So I could see more to go, I've always done that, I liked doing that. I was preparing a lot to have, but this is my hand of inspiration. And then the more to go, the longer I had to prepare for a more and more meager inspiration. It has been time. I didn't like it at all because the lessons are something I liked. Then something that I needed less. What I have left is to write, that it poses other problems, but I don't regret it at all. But I liked it, deeply, it's cool. For example when there is a lot prepared, how long was the preparation? We must think. That's how it is, it's rehearsals for a class. It repeats itself. It's like in the theatre, it's like in ditties. There are repetitions. If you haven't rehearsed a lot, you're not inspired at all. In real life, a course means moments of inspiration. Otherwise, it means nothing. Don't you rehearse in your mirror like that? I am not attractive to these modes of inspiration. But there are no automans who get into their heads and manage to find what they say interesting. It's obvious that if the gentleman who doesn't find what he says very interesting, it won't find you interesting, find passion. And there, it's not vanity, and it's not either finding yourself interesting, you have to find the subject you're dealing with, you have to find it fascinating. Sometimes you have to give yourself a real boost. In any case, it's not interesting, you have to get up, even to the point, where you are able to talk about something with enthusiasm. That's repetition. So I needed it less, and then the races are so special to cross. What is it a cube? It is a cube, that is to say, it is a space-time. And there's a lot going on in a class. I like conferences less. Me, never, but conferences, because conferences are too small a space-time. A course is something that extends, which extends from one week to another. It is a space. It is a very special temporality. It's a sequel. It's not at all that we can make up for what we would have been terrified of. But it is that there is an inner development going on. And then people, from one week to another, changes, all that is questions. The public of a course is something exciting. There, we will start at the beginning, who was first a high school teacher, you have good memories of high school. Yes, yes, because it doesn't mean anything. Because it's been a while in high school because he's become. I understand, I think the young teachers who are very downcast not in high school. Me, I was in high school, I was a high school teacher at the liberation, a moment of liberation, not long after. You are completely different. I am very teacher. I had two provincial towns. I liked a lot, one that I liked less. This you're friend that I liked very much, because it was a city of absolute freedom, a very free city, very... And then, linking that there is a city more, it's true . So, it was still the time when the professor of philosophy, he was received with great kindness. We forgave him a lot because you're a little crazy or the village idiot, for example, he could do whatever you want. Why... Me, I took my students to the so musical, because I did so musical. And everyone has to train normal. I think that now it would be more possible in high schools. And maybe I have how, it was to explain to them what, the musical si. When was that in your class? The curves, not that, yes, it's a thing, as you know, you have to bend it and you get the blood at one place on the curve. And it's moving curves that interest them a lot. It was already on the infinite variation. And this is where you say to yourself? No, but I wasn't just doing that. I was doing the program, I was doing a very conscious teacher. And that's where you met Pauprenes, I believe? Afterwards, yes, I got to know Pauprenes well, he did... But he, traveling more than me, there was very little left for better people. He had a small suitcase and he had a huge alarm clock. He didn't have the watches. And his first young was to take out his alarm clock. He was doing his lessons, with his big alarm clock. He was charming, yes. And who were you friends with in a high school teacher's room? Because when you're a student? Me, gymnastics. There, gymnastics. I'm really good here. Gym teachers, never many. At re-pission, we don't want to open up a very well anymore. The teachers' rooms, the high school, there too, that had to change. You got something. Imagine when you're still a student that the teachers' room is very heavy. It's mysterious and heavy. Oh no, no, it's time. There are all the people, there are the people on the go, there are the regular people. There are all the reasons. Must say, there are not many. Afterwards you made a mistake, were you a teacher at the grand ouch or a preparatory class? Yes yes. And there, you remember the remarkable work that you had and which did not give much? Ah, you haven't given much. Who didn't give much? I don't really know anymore. Yes, I remember them. They gave... But to my knowledge, they gave teachers. They didn't give... I never had lips that became ministers, that became... It's the people who became policemen. But no, nothing special, yes. They sell their ways, they are very good. And then afterwards, there were the Sorbonne years. And one has the impression that the years at the Sorbonne correspond to your years in the history of philosophy. And then, Vincent, Vincent who was a decisive experience after the Sorbonne. Finally, I jump because there was the ion in college. Yes Yes Yes. First of all, you were happy to go back to university after taking university, after taking issée? What have we, that we have not espoutes like that at the level of a dare to your... It was a normal career, what. I will have come back... I had left the issée, I will have come back to the lissée. Yes, I will be... I will not be dramatic, but it would have been normal, a failure, what, yes. It was normal, it was normal. Oh, no, there's no problem, there's nothing to say. But for example, the courses of faculty are differently prepared, precisely that the courses of issée... Not for me, for at all. For you it was the same. Absolutely not, yes, I've always done the lessons the same way. The situation was as intense for smoothing it out as it was for faculty. Oh sure, sure. But in any case, you have to be... Absolutely, imbued with what you have. You have to like to hear yourself, talk, you need all that, you can't do all that. You have to repeat yourself in your head, you have to find the thing by which. We're going, that's even very amusing, you have to find. It's like... It's like a door you couldn't get through in the alposition part. So you prepared your classes exactly the same in high school and college. It was as prepared already in high school as it was later in college. In fact, for me, there was no difference in kind, and between the two kinds of courses. Yes the same. Since we are in your university course, you are going to tell us about your thesis. You passed it on account. Ah my thesis, I passed. I've done a lot of books before, I don't think I do. It is a frequent action. So, I work a lot, and then I say to myself, hey, I have to have my thesis, I have to do this, which is very hard. So, I pushed hard, and then finally, I presented it. I think I was promised the very first tèzes after 68, which are meals. Didn't that do you? In 69, yes, it must be in 69, well, in fact in the first. So, if he gave me a very pre-emptive situation, because the jury only had one entity, it was like in fact to avoid the gangs, who were still wandering around the sorbonne. They had really, they were scared this esth, very start in your lap. But they said to themselves what is going to happen. And I remember that the president of the jury told me, there you go, there are two possibilities. Well, we do your thesis, to retouch, the sorbonne. And there is an advantage, it is that there are two exits. There is something we can say to each other and the jury. But only the inconvenience is that when editing, there are strips that hang around more willingly. So, well, we made it a first floor, so there's an advantage there. It is that the bands go up for a month frequently up to the first floor. But the inconvenience is that there is only one entrance, one exit. So, if there is something, how are we going to be a rocket scientist. So much so that when I passed my entrance, I was never able to meet the gaze of the president of the jury, who was fixed on the door. Who was it ? To find out if he was the bands. Come on, come on, yes. Who was your president of the jury? Ah, I do not know of this asceticism. I can take you out, I follow him... Plus, he was very charming. But he had more emotion than me, emotion, I think. It is rare that the jury is more moved than the candidate seen, it is only circumstances. You are not going to be exceptional. It was already almost more famous than three-quarters of the jury members of the past. No, I could salt you right now. Was it different at those rehearsals? Yes. Finally, you were already well known for your work. Yes yes. So we're going to move on to Vassène, who was... Me, do you have something to say about Lyon after the Sorbonne? No no no no. Vassène, vassène, vassène, it's almost there. Indeed, there is a change. You're right, it's not in the nature of preparation, of what I call rehearsal preparation for a course, nor in the style of a course. It's that, in fact, starting from Vassène, I try to have a student audience. That was the splendor of Vassène. The change of... It was not general in all the faculties. That, that, we were in order, but Vassène remained, or in any case, in philosophy, it's not even true of all Vassène, it was a public of a new type. A complete audience in a new type, which was more made up of students, which mixed all ages, people who came from very different activities, including psychiatric hospitals, like sick, who was the public, maybe, both the most variegated, and finding a mysterious unity in Vassène. Both the most diverse and the most coherent, according to Vassène, Vassène gave this disparate people a unity. And for me, it's an audience. Then, I would have been no better, I did all my life as a teacher at Vassène, but I would have been withdrawn from it for other faculties, I wouldn't even have recognized it. When I went to another faculty, afterwards, I had the impression of traveling back in time to fall back in full ten of messiac life. Before that, I spoke in front of people who were all mixed together, young painters, psychiatric treatment people, musicians, drugs, architect people, since very different, with waves, it varied from year to year, and I'm there who had a year when all of a sudden there were 5, 6 Australians who arrived, we don't know why, the Japanese were constant, the Japanese, every year, the South Americans, the blacks, all that was an invaluable public, a fantastic public. Because for the first time, that is to say, it's a fantastic audience. It was full philosophy which was addressed to philosophers just as much as one has to the philosopher. Exactly, as painting is addressed, it is to shepherds that we don't have. Or the music is not necessarily aimed at music specialists, and it's the same music. It's the same berg, or the same method, which is aimed at both people who are not music specialists and who are musicians. Philosophy must be for me, philosophy must be structurally the same. It is addressed as much to non-philosophers as to philosophers. It will change. Philosophy, when addressed to non-philosophers, does not mean that we are going to make it simple. It's no more than in music that we make things simpler for non-specialists. And there you have it, philosophy speaks. Exactly the same. For me, philosophy has always had a double audition, a non-philosophical audition, as much as a philosophical audition and if there was talk of the liver, that's why philosophy wouldn't mean anything otherwise. Now, explain to me a finesse in lectures. There are non-philosophers and yet you are the lectures. I go to conferences because it's artificial, because it's artificial, it is, and then because of the before and the after. Finally, as much as I love racing, which is a manner of speaking, as much as I will talk. Speaking could really be an activity of... So conferences, speaking before, speaking after, etc. It's not at all the purity of a course. And then the conference, the conference. It's a circus side, the course too, it's a circus side. But it's a circus at least that makes me laugh and that is deeper. There, there is an artifice side, the conference, people go there, they are cold, I don't really know but, the fact that I don't go to conferences. Well, I'm not going to lecture. It's too tense, too p*****, too cheeky, too chebanc. It doesn't seem very interesting and conference to me.
