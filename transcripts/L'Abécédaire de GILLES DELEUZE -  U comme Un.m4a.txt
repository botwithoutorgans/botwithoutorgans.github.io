So, U is one. Mon. Yes, one. A. Yes. Philosophy, science, cut off from the universal. However, you always say that philosophy must remain in contact with singularities. Is there a paradox? Ah, there is no paradox because philosophy, and even science, fruition, has nothing to do with the universal. They are ready-made ideas, they are ideas of opinion. The opinion on philosophy is that it deals with universes at... The opinion on science is that it deals with universal phenomena which can always be repeated, etc. But even if you take a formula like all the cords, if it leaves, what is important is because all the cords, if it is important, it is the fall and the singularities of the fall. That scientific singularities, for example mathematical singularities in functions, or physical singularities, or chemical singularities, freezing fists, etc. be reproducible. We go further and then afterwards, these are secondary phenomena, these are processes of universalization. But what science deals with is not universals, it's singularities. Freezing handles, when a body changes the state, by the litalicate, of a litasolide, etc. A philosophy, which is not of one, of being at all that, is nonsense. She deals with singularity too. One would almost have to say that in fact one always saves oneself in multiplicities. Multiplicities are sets of singularity. The formula of multiplicity or of a set of singularities is ennou reason. That is to say, the 1 is always what must be straired. So the philosophy, I believe that there are two mistakes not to make. Philosophy is not concerned with universals. There are three kinds of universals. To make a report, yes, three kinds of universals, if you will. There are universals of contemplation, ideas with a growth, there are universals of reflection. There are universals of communication. It is the last refuge of the philosophy of universals. In Bermassie, the Mesa, the universals of communication. That implies, we define a philosophy either as contemplation, or as reflection, or as communication. In all three cases, it's comical. It's frankly bullshit. The philosophy that contemplates okay, it makes everyone laugh, the philosophy that is thoughtful, it makes a bet but it's even dumber because we talk. No one needs a philosophy to think about. Like math, they don't need a philosophy to think about math. An artist, he doesn't need to seek a philosophy to think about painting or music. Boulez, he doesn't need to go see a philosophy to think about music. That is to say, philosophy is a reflection on, it's my grips and everything. That's my catch and philosophy. And what he is supposed to reflect on, that there is no need for philosophy to reflect. When you have communication, I don't talk about it, that's... Philosophy is about establishing a consensus in communication. From the world of communication, that's the happiest idea we've heard since. Then, philosophy is lustric to have nothing to do with communication. What doesn't have to do with seeing communication, sugar is fine herself. It is to do with opinion and consensus of opinion, it is the art of questioning, in short. Philosophy has nothing to do. Philosophy once again, we say of opinion at the beginning, it consists in creating concepts. It's not communicated. Art is not communicative. Art is not reflexive. Art is not nelation. It is neither contemplative, nor reflexive, nor communicative. He's creative, that's all. So the formula is minus one removed unity. It is always a suppressed universal.
