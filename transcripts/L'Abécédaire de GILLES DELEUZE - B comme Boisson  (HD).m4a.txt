So B, it's a bit special, it's about the drink. So you drank and then stopped drinking. And I would like to know when you drink-and, what was it? Drink. It was fun, what was it? Ah yes, I drank that a lot. I drank a lot. I quit so I drank a lot. That what it was is not difficult. I believe, I would like a therogy of other people when we drink a lot, a therogy of alcoholics, etc. I believe that to drink it is to do it in quantity. For that, there's no equivalent to food, even there are big eaters, there are people I eat, it's always going to taste bad, so we're not going to do it. But the drink is a question. I understand that we don't drink anything, that each drinker has a favorite saboisson. But it is because it is in this framework that grasps the quantity. It is to do with quantity, what does that mean? People make fun of drugs and alcoholics a lot, because they don't happen, you will say, know, me, I obétrise, I stop drinking when I want. We both laugh, but it's because we don't understand what they want. I have very clear memories, I saw that very well, I believe that all people who drink know that. When you drink, what you want to get to is the last green. Drinking is literally, it's doing everything to accept the last green. That's what interests you. Is it on the limit? Is that the limit, it's complicated. That's what tells you. In other words, an alcoholic is someone who hasn't stopped drinking. It is not to put in the last green. So what does that mean? It's a bit like Pegu's formula, which is so beautiful, it's not the last infidel who repeats the first. It is the first infeat who repeats all the others and the last. The first green, it repeats the last. It's the last that counts. So what does that mean? The last green for an alcoholic. He gets up in the morning, let's say he's a morning alcoholic. There's all the people you want, if it's a morning alcoholic. He's all tense about when he gets to the last green. It is not the first, what is the third that interests him. It's much more, it's banan, it's cunning, an alcoholic. The last green means this, it is valued, there is an evaluation. It is worth what can hold. Without it is crumbling, without it is worth. It is very worth, according to each person. It is therefore worth the last green. And then all the others, it will be his way of passing, of waiting for the latter. And the last one, what does it mean? Meaning, he can't bear to see any more that day. It's the last one that would allow him, that will allow him to begin the endemic again. Because if, if he just goes to the last, and on the contrary, it is the last, in his power. If passes the last in his power, to arrive at the last who is with this his power, he collapses. At that point, he's screwed. Well, he goes to the hospital, or else he has to change his habit, he has to change agency. So when he says the last green, it's not the last, it's the van derdie. He is the archer of the van derdie. When in other words, there is a good green, he doesn't get the last green, he looks for the peultimate green. Not the ultimate. Not the ultimate, not on the ultimate. Master him out of his advantage. And the ultimate is the last before their beginning of the yield. So I can say in the alcoholic, that's what says and who doesn't say it. Come on, that's what we hear in the Ecunfus. She dismisses alcoholic companies, in cafes. We can't stop listening to them. He is the one who always says. Come on, this is the last one. And the last, it will go according to each. And the last is the van derdie. And he's the one who also says, I'm quitting tomorrow. I stop tomorrow? No, he says not, I stop tomorrow. He says I quit today so I can start again tomorrow. And there, since drinking doesn't happen, it's constantly trying to drink. How did one stop drinking, since you stopped drinking completely? It's too dangerous. There, it seems to me that she is going fast. Michoie says it all, before avuie, drug issues and alcohol issues aren't so separate. Michoie says it all on that. There's a mom, it comes from too much barley. Because there too, it's a ridge. When I say the ridge between language and silence, or language and the immalness, it's a ridge, it's a maze scrolling by. It's going very well to drink, to take drugs. We can always do whatever we want. If that doesn't stop you from working. If it's a stimulant, even it's normal to offer something of your body as a sacrifice. Very close, it is very sacrificial, its attitudes of drinks, drugs. We offer our body for sacrifice, why? Probably not, there is something too strong. We couldn't bear it without alcohol. It's not about supporting the alcohol. This is perhaps what we believe to see. We need, what we believe we see, what we believe unproven, what we believe we think, which makes us proving the need, to be able to bear it, to be able to master it. We need help, alcohol, drugs, etc. Second. So he makes the border, it's very simple. That's how drinking, drugging, all that, almost senseless, makes something too strong possible. Even if we have to pay it afterwards, that's good. But in any case, it is linked to this, to work, to work. And then, it's obvious that when there are spills and drinking doesn't work, drugs become a way of not working. It is the absolute danger. It no longer has any TV. And at the same time, we realize more and more that, there, we believe CC's alcohol, where CC's drug is absolutely not CC. Maybe you have to have been there to realize that everything you thought you could do, thanks to her or thanks to alcohol, you could do without. So, I really admire the way Michaud says, well no, it's become all that. He stops. Me, I drink of merit because I stopped me when it's because of breathing, health, etc. But it is obvious that it is necessary to stop, or that it is necessary to do without it. The only small justification possible is if it helps the work, even if we have to pay for it physically afterwards. But more and more in 20, the more we say to ourselves that it helps for work. So... Since the start, like Michaud, you have to have done a lot of drugs, you have to have drunk a lot to be in such a state. And on our part, you say, when you drink, it mustn't prevent you from working, but it's because we've glimpsed something that the drink is dissupporting. This something is not life. So there, there is the question, obviously, about the writers that you have a lot. That's life. It's something too strong in life. It's not at all something necessarily terrifying, it's something too strong. It is something too powerful in life. So we believe in a somewhat silly way, because I'm going to put you on the level of something more powerful. If you take the whole line, there are Americans, great Americans. But it's during... The during of what I admire the most is Thomas Wolf. All this is a civil alcoholic. By putting that this is what allows them, no doubt they help them to perceive something too big for. Yes, but it's also because they belonged to something of the power of life that not everyone can perceive. You felt she was at the end of the power of life. That's it. Obviously that's it. It's not Health Hitolfra's alcohol. There was a power of life, in France, for them, but that only they could see. Totally agree. Totally agree. And their lives, the same. Totally agree. Of course. They made one of a real moroccan. That's where the booze is for them. They risked it, because they thought of you because it helps them. I had the feeling that it helped me to make concepts. It's weird. To make philosophical concepts. Yes, it helped me. And then, I realized that it helped me more, or that I was bored, or that I could quickly work on it if I needed to. What should you dance? That's all. It's more of an American tradition, because we don't know a lot of infranchised children who entrust their pensions for alcohol. And besides, we have enough trouble. There is something that is part of the readings. Yes, we have... The writings of infrancées are not the same vision of writing. I don't know if I was marked so much by the Americans. It is a question of vision. It's clairvoyance. They considered there only philosophy, writing. It's a bit the question of very in all, really in a modest way, even something. Even something that others don't see. It's not quite the French conception of literature. So, I was asked if I had a lot of alcohol, too, in France. But it's still rather off, alcohol, in France. It is a lot of difficulty, finally, that, we know. But we also don't know many philosophers who entrust their pensions. L'Avité Ruinolais, very close to here. If we accept a word, we know. When I take the Ruinolais, I say to myself, no doubt, it was Verlene's route to go to the café, in his absence. They are there, even dwell at the door-bendminable. That, the poets, yes, the poets, and alcohol, know it better. The literary poet, French, who would trail Ruinolais. It is a wonder. At the friends bar. Yes, in all. Finally, the poets, yes, we know that there have been more... tillites. Alright, we're done with the booze. We will spend enough. So it's vast.
