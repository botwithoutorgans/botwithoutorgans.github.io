Okay, we're going to move on to F. Let's move on to F, yes. F, I chose the word fidelity. Loyalty to talk about the job, since you have been with Jean-Pierre Bambergé for 30 years and not a day goes by, its what you call or you see. And it's like a coup, anyway you're loyal to your profession, you're loyal to Felix Guatari, to Gérôme Lendon, I'm going to quote... And the I, Jean-Pierre Bambergé, to Pierre Chevalier, your friends are very important to you. And François Châtelet, or Michel Foucault, who were your friends, you will have paid homage to him, as to friends, with great fidelity. So I would like to ask you, this impression that loyalty is necessarily linked to the profession for you, or the reverse, and fair. It's not just fidelity, yes, it's like a plus ocean at F, but fidelity is something else, yes, fidelity is something else. The profession for me, is a bed of what heart, it is for me, it is the inferno of perception. Here too. It's the fact of... It's not that we have common ideas, but what does it mean to have something like that with someone? It's an idea, not unity, we understand each other without having to explain ourselves. It's not from common ideas, but we have a common language, or a pril common language. There are people who don't take anything from what they say, even if they say things like that, even if they don't say, I'm the only one, I mean what is saying that? On the contrary, there are some, he talks to me about an extremely abstract subject, and I don't agree with them, I understand everything. I understand as well, that means, I'm going to tell them something, and they have something to tell me. And it is not at all the community of hesitation, which there, it is a mystery. It's what it's indeterminate funds that makes... Well, well a 14, are you in detail? Is it talking about the story? Oh good, yeah. So yes, it's true that... There, there is a great mystery, this fact of... having something to say to someone, without tendency, there is without a common idea, without compensating for me. is not it ? I have a hypothesis is that ... every year we and apt to grasp a certain type, I had no one to grasp all types, at once, a certain type of charm, there is a perception of charm. And what do I call charm? There, it's for the whole thing where I want to bring some monsexuality back into the profession, there, not at all, but a gesture from someone. Someone's thought, even if it is before it is significant, or someone's gesture, someone's modesty. It's solder chargers, when they go so far to the girl, to the vital roots, that that's how you become someone's mis. If you take sentences, well, from someone, there are sentences, there are sentences that can be said, that if the person who said it is vulgar, or indieable, a type of sentence, we you have to look for examples for the time, then every year there are examples. For me, for each year of us, there are sentences, if you hear a sentence in style, you say to yourself, God, what am I hearing? There, what is it? If the world, you must not believe that you can say a sentence like that by a-sale, and then he caught up, there are sentences that cannot, and conversely, for the charm, there are sentences but quite different, who are going to be loaded, who show a certain delicacy, you say, but, there's you, this one, he's mine, not the center of ownership, he's fine, and I hope be more extinguished, be there, the trade, the trade perhaps. So, there are many questions of perception, to perceive something that suits you, that teaches you, that takes you out, that wakes you up to something. Yes ? That's it, that's it. Now, you say very well, there is only that. Someone who is a good sign, we receive them, we don't receive them, we have them well, but all the inhabited ones, I believe, are fairly based there, and also sensitive or put there by someone. I think that's what explains it. So, nature, we can't, it's someone who comes out to bring it back, or preferably in 10 years, it's for 10 years things completed, you, significant, in 10 years, generally, in 10 years, things. It's comedy, the job is comedy. There are a lot of comedy about couple of friends in repeated bouverts, or quests, thank you for... With Jean-Pierre, I say to myself well yes, we are pale reproductions of Merciel and Kabien, yes, it's ... It's... It's... Jean-Pierre, he's me, I'm tired all the time, my health is fragile, Jean-Pierre is hipocombre, and a conversation is very , indeed, Merciel and Kabien, what we were saying, the dialeau of how you are, and the other answer, I'm pumped up, but not completely pumped. There, it's a sentence so dear, somewhere, that we love, to the one who said it, how are you, like a cork, not the autity, not the sea, well, that's it fee, fine. With the lines, it's different. With the lines, I won't be Bercier and Kabien, I'll be more... I don't know... You were hit on me at the World Cup. We threw ourselves, when he's in everything we've done, we leave in our work, we threw ourselves into an attempt, we got knocked out, it's really... c he's of the Rattian type, we have the same brand of hats, and then, the attempt, the encyclopedic attempt, to construct a book, which tackles all knowledge, with another, we will move on again, from orelernia, I don't don't mean that you have to imitate, it's a great couple, but that's what living in it is. Great friends, it's beautiful, we're going to pass it on, it's Kabien, thank you, it's the orelan, even if they are disputed, scrambled, it can bring. Yes yes. So obviously, in the question of the profession, there is a kind of mystery. I mean, it's about the three philosophy pipes. That's the philosophy, as everyone notices, there's put into the word. I mean that philosophy surpasses itself, first of all to please everyone, and it presents itself literally as a friend of wisdom, there is a friend. What the Greeks invented was not wisdom, it was very bizarre friends of wisdom. What can he mean, friend of wisdom? That's the problem of what is philosophy, what can it be friend of wisdom, we mean that, weight. It means that it is the passage of wisdom. So obviously, there is an easy interpretation, he owes you wisdom. We're not going to... What inscribes the profession in the philosophy and what type of friendship? Does it have to... Is it related to a friend? What's wrong with you? What does that mean, friend of wisdom? I say once again, if we have an interpretative like the one who is towards you, it is indeed the one who claims wisdom without being wise. But pretender to wisdom, it means that there is another who pretender, is never the only pretender. If a suitor has the girl, there are several suitors. It's that the girl has several suitors. Aren't you promised, aren't you promised wisdom? You are not promised wisdom. I claiming wisdom. But then, well, there are pretenders to wisdom and Greeks that they invented, that's the advance, what they invented is the phenomenon of pretenders. That is to say, what they invented was the idea that had rivalry of free men in all fields. Elsewhere, the idea of rivalry between free men does not exist. But in Greece, yesだから, the locances, for that, that they are so procedural, it is the rivalry of free men. They are trials of free men. Friends are lawsuits. In any case, young boys or women have suitors, Penelope's suitors, there are suitors. That's it, that's the Greek phenomenon par excellence. For me, it's not the miracle, the Greek phenomenon, it's the rivalry of free men. So, that explains to me the philosophy, he claims, there is a rivalry towards something, towards what. So, we can interpret if you take the history of philosophy, that, there is that for which, indeed, philosophy is linked to this mystery of the profession. There is what is linked to the mystery of betrothed. But maybe it's not far, who look. The fiancènes will sing more, they don't have the philosophy on the fiancènes sailleront, without the first love. I zigné, but how we said earlier, the first love, it is perhaps the repetition of the déradié, it is perhaps the last love. There is the philosophy, maybe the couple had the important thing in philosophy, it's very curious. Me, I don't think we get tired of it, that it's only philosophy, that we can settle our questions with it, of finance and of the friend, what is that? friend, all that, that's what's very interesting, it's going away, in fact, very interesting. And Blanchot, in the profession, he has grown a little. Ah, but Blanchot, it's white part, play me what we have. It's typical, it's the two current men who, in relation to philosophy or even thought, give importance to the profession. But in a very particular sense, they do not tell us, one must have a friend to be philosophers or to think. They consider that the profession is a category or a condition of the exercise of thought. That's what's important. It's not the made friend. It is because friendship as a category is a condition for thinking. Whence the male relationship in such, for example, whence the relationship whence Blanchot's declarations on the job, can bring that the envage would have rather comidated that I adambe wary of the friend. For me, she put her. It is reinfiance. An hour ago, there is a glass that I adore, that I love very much, that I appreciate very much, a poetal, which is between Chia and Lou, the hour at which is challenged. Chia, between Chia and Lou, the hour at which you have to blunder even about the friend. An hour ago, you have to blunder even about the friend. Me, I don't trust my leggings, like the plague, I don't trust my friends. But I'm wary of it with your gang, I thought he could do bad things, because when he does, it's very funny, very good, very very. No it's. There's such an understanding, there's such a community between friends, or with the fiancé, or with me, I don't mind anything. But if you want, you mustn't believe that all that is events, small private affairs. There too, it's when we say inhabited, when we say the lost fiancé, etc., these are, it's a question of knowing under what conditions thought can be exercised. For example, prouste considers that the trade is 0. Not only for him, for his account, but perhaps for thought, there is nothing to think about in the trade. There is a reverse thought, in jealous love. This is the condition of thought. I would like to ask you the last question about friends. It seems that with Foucault, Châtelet is yet another case, since you were his friend when he was liberated and you did all your studies together. But with Foucault, you have a friendship which was not that of a blow of which you have with Jean-Pierre or with Felix or with Ely, or with Jerome, since one will speak again a crowd of enclosures jumped from the others. With Foucault, the profession was very profound. Yet she was distant. She had something much more formal for someone who was exterior. So what was this friendship? It was surely that he was the most mysterious for me, maybe when it was when it was too late, maybe Foucault, it was a very big regret for me. And since I had a lot of respect for him, I was ready to try to... Must say, until I got him, I was going to perceive him and it's one of the rarquats of the soul, which entered in a room, it changed, it changed the atmosphere. Foucault is not simply a person, moreover, none of us was a person. It really was like an air, another air, like it was a special draft, and things changed. There was no more... It was really atmospheric, where there was a sort of emanation. There was an emanation, Foucault, there was... Because someone sees radiation, there was something to associate it with, it spreads what I was saying earlier, it was streets -nats. There was no need to speak with him. We never talked about something that made us laugh, and it's seeing someone, and saying to each other, not even having to say to each other, that's what makes us laugh today, that 'we are almost what happens, what makes us laugh in all these disasters, what makes us... Oh, there you go, what is he. But Foucault, it's for me, it's the memory of someone who is... Yes, so when I talk about someone's charm, someone's gesture, Foucault's gestures are amazing. Also, well, gesture, that's a bit like the gestures of metal and dry wood. It's very strange gestures for you, fascinating gestures, very moving, very... We're finally going to see each other. ... That people have charm only through their faumie, that is what is difficult to understand. It's the side, it's... The real charm of people, it's the side where they lose, the faggots, it's the side where they lean very well, they are, it doesn't want to say that they collapse on the contrary, it is people who do not collapse. But if you don't get it, the little racide, the little gran, the madness, it's someone, you can't put them on. I can't put them on, it's the side where he's completely, somewhere, we all put on, we all put on a little... a little insane. If you don't get the little crazy dot, it's someone. So, I'm afraid where I dig on the contrary, I'm glad that someone's point of destruction is either the source of his charm even goes. Yeah.
