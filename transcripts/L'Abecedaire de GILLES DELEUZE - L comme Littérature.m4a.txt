So she is literature. She, not without her. Already. Yes. So the literature in philosophy is dead. You read and reread a lot of books. And interature. We call it great literature. You have always treated great writers as thinkers. Between the Kant and the Nietzsche, you shout prousses your signs, that you have a famous book and that you will increase thereafter. Les Whiskyrolles, Zola, in G. Dissence, Mazok, Kafka, American English literature. And sometimes we even have the impression that it was through literature more than through the history of philosophy that you are a work and a new thought. So I would like to know first if you have always read a lot. Oh yes. Yes Yes Yes. Ah, mum, I read a lot more philosophy, since I had to, it was part of my job, part of my apprenticeship. So I didn't have a lot of time to read novels, but I've been choosing great novels all my life, yes, more and more. Besides. So does it come down to anything for philosophy surely? It serves me. For example, what I owe to Fitzgerald, who is nevertheless not very philosophical, what I owe to Fitzgerald is immense. What I have, Fault-Mair, is very big too. Well, yes, I forget, there, I'm not well. But that's self-explanatory, precisely, based on what I've been told, because we've made a lot of progress, so it didn't escape your notice. The concept of exile I'm going to do. The concept, at the same time, pursues its task, it shows things. That is to say, he is in the branch of percepts. And here all of a sudden, these percepts, we find them in a big time. There are perpetual communications from concept to percept. Then, more, there are problems of style which are the same in philosophy and in literature. The great characters, the great characters, on the other hand, have very, very, very beautiful literary characters. They are great thinkers. I go out to fly a lot of mixed cities. It's going to be either that the owner of a cable is a great thinker. It'll either be that Martin B. is a thinker. A long way thinker is not the same kind of thinker. But he is a thinker. In any case, we must think so well that a literary work traces as many dotted concepts as percepts. Yes this. Completely. Simply, it is not the task of literature, because it cannot do everything at once. He is caught in this problem of percepts, irons to see, to make perceived and to create characters, to create characters, I am too conceived that it is to create a character. It's an amazing thing, it's a... And the philosopher is creating concepts, but it happens to communicate a lot, because the concept, in certain aspects, is a character. And the character has the dimension of a concept, I believe. I believe. This is what is common, for me, if there would be common is that the two activities. Great literature and great philosophy testify for life. That's what I called power, or earlier. He testifies for life. That's even why they don't have a lot of health. That great heights have no good health. Except sometimes, there are cases with the Hugo, yes, with the Hugo, it's so... I don't take laughs that don't have a lot of health, since on the contrary there are some who will have very high health . But why are there litterateurs who do not have great health of the type? And it's the same, perhaps, through which passes, but a flow of life. It is precisely for that. I have some ways whether it's small Ossu-Linosa health, or small Aurance health. What is this ? That's almost a bit what I said on the complaint. They saw something too big for them. They saw, it's misleading. They saw something too big for them. They are not capable of you, we cost it, it breaks them. Chevovres, that's what we got. For what ? Why Checovres? Brie at this point. He saw something. Philosophers and writers are on the same point. There are things that one manages to see, and from which, literally in a certain way, one does not come back. What is this ? It suits him a lot for the heights. But generally, it is precisely percepts at the limit of the tenable, or concepts at the limit of the thinkable. That's what does. So between a concept, between the creation of a great character and the creation of a concept, I see the link so much that it's a bit like the same company. And you, do you consider yourself a writer, the girl? How to say a literary writer? I don't know that, I don't know if I consider myself a writer in philosophy. I know that every great philosophy is a great writer. There is an esthology of romantic offer, when one is a great philosopher, I speak for you. No, because it doesn't arise, it's as if you were telling the pliers not to make music. There are cases where one can very well consume a philosophy which makes it deronant on the other hand. Why not ? It was... I don't think it would have been restarted, but he tried it. Have there been cases of great philosophers making an important novel that I know of? No, I don't see that much. But on the other hand, I see philosophers who have created characters. It happened only philosophers who created characters and characters, and characters, including Sarah Toustra. There, there are these crossings in your talk. All the time, Sarah Toustra's creation will speak. Poetitically, utterly, a successful mass, like the Platonic characters. These are points where we no longer know very well what is a concept and what is a character. That may be the poorest members. And your love for secondary authors, like Villiers de Lille-Adan or RÃ©tive de la Bretonne, have you always cultivated this affection? It was really weird to hear. Villiers de Lille-Adan is a secondary member. But the question. So, that's the question. I'm going to say, it's a strange thing, it's all appalling. It was when I was very young, I had an attitude, I had the idea of reading an author completely, his complete work. What meant that I had fiction for not secondary authors, but often sticks to authors who had written very little. And there too, it was too big for me, Victor Hugo. It wasn't so much that I was ready to tell you Victor Hugo, it wasn't good. But that on the other hand, Paul Louis Courier, I knew him almost by heart, she is not Paul Louis Courier, I knew him inside out. It really wasn't much, what he had written. So I had this taste for secondary authors, but it was so seceur, but secondary in his time compared to great... Joubert! Joubert! I know this Joubert thoroughly. We're going all that. You don't have that andale sand, so there you really know the shame. It gives me a certain prestige, I knew the unknown authors. Finally little known. Well, all of that was nonsense. I took a long time to take Victor Hugo all the same, it was grandiose. And that the humanity of the new was not one. In my love for secondary authors, it's rather... No, it's true, it's true that ten secondary authors, it's true that Russian literature doesn't exist in our soyevsky and Tolstoy . And if we have the secondary conscripts, someone like the scoff, it's so surprising that I have the scoff. Finally, that... So, finally, it's still a screen, it's for... Well, but I don't feel I don't have much to say, it's you. Anyway, it's not me... It's not me... It's their dear secondary author. No, what the only authors have is their dear husband to find in an author who is not codi. Something that seems to me to be a concept, you, a character, with its author, that has me... Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I have no research, I say, this is my technique. But apart from the proust which is a big book on an author. Literature, it is so present in your philosophy, one can say at one time that it is a reference for examples, but you have never really devoted a large book to literature, a book of thought to literature. I didn't have time, but I did. I'm walking you in and you weren't... No, I'm going to do that. I will do it because I want to. Of criticism? Criticism finally of... yes, on the problem of... yes, how? What does written mean? Yes, yes, in literature. For me, yes. Yes, it is at the top of the bottom, it says everything to the big program. We'll see if I have time. Yes. So, I asked you one last question, it's that you read and reread the classics, but we don't really get the impression that you say a lot of contemporary tors, or that you're not so many discoverers. of contemporary literature. That is to say that you always preferred to take a great author or re-read an author than to see what comes out, or what is directly to us... It's not that I don't like... Contemporarily. There, I understand what you mean. And I didn't have very fast. It's not at all that I don't like. This is a real special activity and very difficult. And where is where you have to be trained. Very difficult in a contemporary production to have the taste. It's just like people finding new shepherds. There too, it is not by its appearance. You learn that, I greatly admired people who sell galleries and who say and who have the feeling that there really is a herdsman there. And I am not capable. I have always needed so. I bring to give reason. It took me less than five years to understand a little the novelty of... Well, what's next? But the novelty of Robgrillet. I was also dumb, the dumbest, by the angle of Robgrillet in his debut. I understand is nothing. It took me time. It took me five years. Me, I am not a discoverer. So, in philosophy, I believe, there, I'm more sure than... I'm immediately sensitive to the new tone and to what is on the contrary... a hum of the repetition of things said a thousand times. But in the novel, I am very sensitive. There, I'm just sure enough of myself for what has already been disked a thousand times, it is of no interest to me. But know if. It happened to me once for Farachi. To your chosen ones, I still found it in my own way. I found someone who seemed to me a good novel, it's young. Who was, who is arming Farachi. Fine, but I'm going to say what you... There, the question you're asking me is full of justification. But I don't answer by saying, you shouldn't believe that it's when you can without judged experience of what is being done. So, I almost tell myself that what I prefer is... what happens and once again what makes me happy. It's when what I do on my side, she hides it and... Either I write it, or else I don't graze. I don't tell myself why, he's good and good, if I'm good. I'm not saying that. But there, I have a type of encounter with what is currently happening, which is of another mode. I mean, my radical inadequacy when it comes to judgment is offset by his encounters. With people doing things that echo what I do. And vice versa. For painting, the cinema, for example, it favors itself, it is a duiva encounter. Is it for the free laughs, it's hard to imagine, going into a free laughs and looking at the books that have come out in the past two months? Yes indeed. But it may also be linked to the idea that it won't force you. Not in... It's not in my head, and it's not preconceived that's obvious, that literature isn't going very well. Right now. And then she's so corrupt, so we're not even talking about all that, she's so corrupted by the system. Distribution, prices, etc. That... That it's even more worth it. You, we'll move on to M. Which isn't good.
