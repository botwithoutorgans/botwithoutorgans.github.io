X is an unknown, Y is a visible, so we go directly to the last letter of the Alphabet and the last letter of the Alphabet is Z. Ah well, that's a whirlwind. So it's not the Z of Zorro just here, as we understood through this alphabet, not judgment, but it's the Z of bisurcation, of lightning. It is he who has in the name of the great philosophers. Zéne, Zara, Tustra, Leibniz, Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergzone, obviously from Euse. Ah, that's very spiritual. Spirituals with Bergzone is very nice for me. Zéne, well yes it's informal, and then it makes us join. Ah the fly, the Zen of the fly, the Zen of the fly, the Zen of the fly, it is the Zen of the fly. It's the last word. There is no word after Zena. Good to end on this. So what is actually going on in the Zene? Zéne is the opposite of the nose which also extended Zéne to it. It's the movement, the fly, what is that, that? Perhaps it is the elementary movement. It is perhaps the movement which presided over the creation of the world. You feel bad about it, I take care of it like everyone else. I see that it takes pretty hot on the Big Bang, the creation of the universe. The curvy girl says it all, how it happened at the Big Bang. It is necessary to say at the origin of things, there is not the Big Bang, there is another. THANKS. So the Zéne de la mouche, the Big Bang, the hidden mission. It should be replaced by the Zéne which is indeed, which is the Zéne, which is the course of the fly. It means to believe. For me, it's still a bit that the Zéxac is what we were saying earlier about not universals but sets of singularity. The question is how to relate disparate singularities, to relate or potentials. If we speak as in terms of physics, we can imagine a chaos, a potential, how to relate potentials. So I no longer know in which vaguely scientific discipline, we have a term that appealed to me so much that I took advantage of it in a book. They explained that between two potentials, this passed to Phenomenon, and that they did not define the idea of a dark precursor. The dark precursor is so much about connecting different potentials. And once there was the path of the dark precursor, the two potentials were like in a state of reaction there and between the two, flashed the visible event, the clear ones. There was the dark precursor and then the clear ones. That's how the world goes. There is always a dark precursor that no one sees, and then the clear ones that eliminate, and that's the world. You, that should be the thought, that must be Sophie's daughter. That's the big Z. And that's also the wisdom of Zéne. The sages are the dark precursor and then the stroke of the baton, since the master of Zéne spends his time discussing the stroke of the baton. The stroke of the stick is the lights that make things visible. And so, we are done. I'm glad to have a Zen in your name. Delighted. So. What a good hour, the end. Oh, here it is. Poster, my poster, my poster. Poster. Well, here it is. But thank you everyone I have.
