2nd plaha. It is really good. So what is it? Philosophy rested questions, problems and the questions were fabricated. And as you say, the goal does not wait to answer that to get out of these questions. So for example, leaving the history of philosophy was creating new questions for you. But here, in an interview, we don't ask questions, it's not really questions. So how am I gonna get through this and how are you gonna get through this? What do we do ? Finally, the forced choice? First, what is the difference between a question, in the media and a question in philosophy, to start at the beginning? It's difficult because at the... I say, it's more difficult because we have... In the media, most of the time, or in the conversation to get back, let's say, there is no question, there is no problem. There are questions. If I say how are you, it's not a problem. Even if you are bad. If I say she would have been, that's not a problem. All that is questions, we wonder. If you watch the level of regular television, even in very serious broadcasts, these are questions. What do you think of this? This is not a problem. It's a question, it's a question, it's your opinion. Well, no. That's why TV isn't very interesting. This is the opinion of the jambas. It doesn't seem to me to have a very fraternal life. If we say, do you believe in God? It is a question. Where is the problem, is the question no question? So much more if we ask questions or questions, yes, yes. If we ask questions or problems. In a TV show, it will indeed be necessary, it is cerenic, yes, okay. But that doesn't happen often. It doesn't go often. Political broadcasts don't include any acknowledgment that we have no problem. One could, one could say, for example, in legs, but how does the question chie-boise suppose? No one will come to me from the specialists of China. Who tell us about China, currently, things that we could have said all that, without knowing a word about China. It's not so much. It's a computer's empathy at all. I go back to my example because big gods, hey, gods. What is God's problem or question? It's because you believe in God or not, if you don't have such a space for many people. And what does that mean? When we say the word &quot;God&quot;, what does it mean? What does it mean ? So I imagine the questions. It could mean, are you going to be judged after you die? How is that a problem? Because it removed a problematic relationship between God and the moment of judgment. Is God a judge? It's a question. And then, then, I guess we are told not to scale. Yes, not scale. He wrote a famous text. It's Paris. Does God exist or does God not exist? We bet. And then, we say the text not scale. We realize that it is absolutely not about that. For what ? Because that's another question he asks. The question of not scale, it is not that God exists or does God not exist? What is finally a question, here too, not very interesting, is that it is the best mode of existence. The mode of existence the one who believes that God exists, or the mode of existence the one who believes that God does not exist. It is good that the question of not scale, it absolutely does not concern the existence of God, or the non-existence of God. The existence of the one who believes that God does not exist, for reasons that the development is his own, but who are very disciples, he thinks that the one who believes that God exists has a better existence than the one who believes that God does not exist. It's his business. This is making it Pascalian. There, there is a problem and there is a question. It is already no longer God's question. There is an underlying history of questions and transformations of vegetable questions into others. Similarly, when it says God is dead, it does not mean the same thing that God does not exist. So I can say, if I say God is dead, what question does that refer to, which is not the same as when I say God does not exist. And then, in his perspective, if it is innate that God does not exist, God is absolutely not dead. And that's another question that comes through there. Namely that if God is dead, there is no reason that man also is not dead. It is therefore necessary to find something other than man, etc. What interests him is not that God is dead, it is that he interests, it is the future of something other than man. All that is the art of questions and problems. So me, I think it can be done on my television, but or in the media. But it will make for a very special type of show. This is what is under-assessing problems and questions. Whereas with so well in the conversation grante, that in the media, one remains within level of the interrogations. I don't know where to quote. Yes, it's not all that. Their truth is really questions. Their Madame Veille, do you believe in Europe before? All right. What's to come for Europe? What is interesting is good. What is Europe's problem? Europe's problem? I will say it all. Because that way, for once, I would have a present. It's the same as China now. He thinks all this prepares Europe to standardize Europe and wonders about it. As we are going to standardize insurance, etc. And then there will be a Place de la Concorde 1 million children from all over Oldalmania, etc. And he dominates in Paul Drug, he dominates in Paul. Their very well. To care there, it frank to say specialists for recourses to the explained who were the Oldal in places of the Concorde. Ah well, it's over, we did the aé, etc. Well, they missed the questions. At the time when it was necessary to pose them, one made a little confused all that well. For example, you think in years you have read a daily newspaper and it seems to me that you read more daily the world or liberation. There is something in the level of the press and the media precisely not to ask these questions. Oh well I feel like I don't know. Who disgusts him? Ah yes, it's all ready. We have the feeling of learning less and less. Ah, no I have everything ready, I would like to learn stuff in serien. We don't know at all, we don't know how the newspapers tell us anything, either, I don't really know. But you, watching the news every day, then... Fifth! The air of the oppu, the time that it is 4°, it is only the hand. Go ahead, clear. But you, for example, each time you watch the television news since it's the only program you never miss, you have an unspoken question each time, which is not formulated, which is forgotten by the media. Ah, I don't know tonight. I don't know. But you rather feel that we never forgot what? The questions, I believe, to the limit that we could not ask them. If you take the very old story, we can't ask the questions, the story, I take a very recent story. We stop everything old. Why now ? So everyone says, why was he protected? But everyone, it's good that there must be stories. He was an intelligence chief. He must have information on the conduct of Church netary audits during the war, all that. Everyone knows that the corner is aware, but the agreed do not make up the questions and that we will not marry. This is called consensus. It is convenience, convention, after which questions and problems will be replaced by questions. Questions like, how are you? That is to say... Ah, such a convent, the hidden one... Why? Everyone knows that's not the issue. Everyone knows. Everyone knows. So I'll take another example, it's between right-hand renemvators and right-hand devices. Everyone knows what it is. The newspapers tell us that we don't tell love. I don't know, I say it like that, it's obvious to me that between the renemvateurs on the right, there is a very interesting problem. It's summer, it's not who is particularly young, their young is... It consists of this, it's an attempt by the right, to shake up the party apparatuses which are still centralized apparatuses on Paris. The independence of the regions goes to him. It's very interesting, it's quite interesting. But nobody like this on this aspect and their connection to Europe, which wants to do it, not a Europe of Nations, it wants to do it a Europe of regions. He wants true unity to be regional and inter-regional, not national and inter-national. That's a problem. And the socialists in Ortou, they will have this problem between regionalist tendencies and tendencies. But the party apparatuses, the provincial federations in the unions, in the party stuff, in the federations. If still via he was handling, namely, it goes back to Paris and the weight, he is very centralized. Right-wing renemvateurs, it's an anti-Jacobin moment. That the left will also have that. So, I say to myself, in fact, we should make them talk about it, but they won't say it, they refuse to talk about it. They refuse to talk about it, because at that moment, they discover themselves. They will only ever answer questions, for questions, it's nothing, it's conversation, it's of no interest. The conversation, that, never had the discussions, that, no interest. TV, except exceptionally, the fights of discussion, the interrogations, all that. But it's nothing. It's not even that it hears me, it's so difficult. At Canaderet. Me, I'm less optimistic than you, me, I have the impression that there is a saint clair who, in the consensus, she doesn't notice it, she thinks she's asking good questions, she doesn't is not at all in the intergacon. Oh yeah, but that's his business. I'm sure she's very happy, she's yes, yes, yes. That's for sure, but that's his business. You never agree to go on television. We have to try to hell, if we would stay in the bay, to go on television? Why don't you want to be on television for all these reasons? As proof, here I go. But my reason won't go through with it, it has to be exactly what I just said. Me, I have no desire to have conversations, discussions with people. I don't follow the questions. That doesn't interest me. And the discussions, I'm not in relation to what I'm discussed about things. When no one knows what problem it is. If it lives on inexépage, I resume my story of God. What is a question of an existence of God, of the death of God, of the death of man, of the existence of God, of the existence of the one who believes in God, etc., is a boil is very tiring. So everyone in turn, everyone spoke about all that. But it's domesticity, it's tapure, plus a bullshit presenter, but pity, pity. The main fact is that you are here today to answer our little questions. Attit, too costume.
