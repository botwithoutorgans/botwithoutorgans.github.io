Here we are going to come back to your dear Vassane audience who was very mixed, but me in those Vassane years when there were crazy people, drugs as you said, as you said, who made wild interventions , who spoke, never, never, it didn't seem to bother you. All the interventions were in the middle of your course which remained masterful and no intervention for you had value of objection. That is to say that there was always this masterful aspect of your course. It would be necessary to invent a different way, it is the world which imposes on itself an inverse citema, a lecture course. One might need another way, that is to say, there are two conceptions of a course, I believe. A design after which a course aims to obtain reactions to these immediate from an audience, this form of question, need for interruption, it is a whole current, it is a whole design of a course. And then on the contrary, the so-called masterful conception, there is the gentleman who speaks. Me, I've always had, I don't know that I prefer Noulou, I have no choice. Me, I've only ever remembered the second, the so-called masterful conception. So, we would have to find, I say a different way, because the limit is more a musical conception of a lesson. For me, a course, you don't interrupt the music, whether it will be good or my bladder. Or else, we interrupt her if she's too my vese. But we don't interrupt music, as long as we can very well, we don't interrupt words. So, what does a musical conception of a lesson mean? I believe two things. Finally, in my experience, without at all saying that it is this design that is the best. I say mine as I see things, as I know myself, an audience, or what my audience has been. I tell myself, it always happens that someone does not understand at the time. And then there are what should be called delayed effects. The other too, it's a bit like in music. At the time, you don't understand a movement. And then, three minutes later, it comes from a pite, or 10 minutes later. Because it's not a maintenance thing. The delayed effects of a course, a little very well in understanding nothing at the time. 10 minutes later, it lights up. There is a retractive effect. If the interrupter is already prostrate enough, I find the interupions, or even the questions that can be asked, amazing to me. You ask a question because you're not understanding, but you just have to wait. So, these interruptions, you thought they were stupid because we didn't wait? Yes, because... There's that, there's this first aspect. What someone does not understand. Although possible, he is the understands after all alone. I find the best students are the ones who ask questions the week after. I had a system at the end, I didn't unless he had invented it, sometimes he would pass me a little note from one week to the next. Never much. I was told, we must come back to this point. But they had waited, we have to come back to this point, I didn't, it didn't matter, but there was this communication. And then, the second very important point, in a course as I see it, for me, it was courses that lasted 2 hours, no one can listen to someone for 2 hours. So, for me, a course has always been something that is not meant to be understood in its entirety. A lesson was Mathieu's spirit in motion, it was really a Mathieu in motion. And that's where it's musical. And in which each, or each group, or each student, limits it, takes what suits him the wrong way, it is something which, literally, suits no one. But we cannot say that everything is suitable for everyone. So people have to wait, almost at the limit, it was obvious that some of them slept halfway. And then by what mystery wakes up at the moment that he is conserving. There is no law saying in advance, this will concern such and such, it's not even the subjects that interest them in anything else. A lesson is emotion. It's so many emotions of intelligence, there are no emotions, there is nothing, there is no interest. So it's a question of following everything, even listening to everything. It's about waking up, waiting to grab what suits you, what suits you personally. And that's why he published very varied and very very important. Because we train well, there are intelligent places that jump from one to another. And that forms a kind of splendid fabric, of texture, of texture. There, yes, that's it. So that's the audience, but for this concert, precisely, you invented the word pop philosophy and pop philosophers. Yes, that's what she meant. Yes, but we can say that your look like that of Foucault was something very special. And I mean your hat, your nails, your voice. Are you aware that... There was a kind of mitification of the students of this pace. As, moreover, they mitigated Foucault as they mitigated Val's voice. Do you think you have to have a look and then a particular voice? Oh yeah, sure, that. Certainly, since the voice in a course, but if philosophy, as we said, we have already talked about it, it seems to me a little bit, philosophy is mobilized, it deals with concepts. With there is a vocalization of concepts in a course, yes, that's normal. Just as there is a style of the concepts seems to be written, the philosophy is not already written. Without research, without developing a style, it's like artists, it's artists. Well, a class involves vocalizations, yes. It implies, yes, let's go, it even implies. I don't know the almane kind of cheerful spraise. Well yes, that, of course, of course. While there are myths about it, we had these nails, that's part of all the problems, but already in primary school, it's like that. But what is more important is the relationship between the voice and the concept, it is the relationship, yes. Me, you have to please all the same, you chappouses, you are when the little black dress of pien, there was a very precise pace. Yes, finally, my art, it is that I did not put for that. So if it produces this effect, we'll be fine, very good, very good. It's part of the role of the teacher. Is this part of the teacher's role? No, that's not part of the teacher's role. It's a supplement. If it's part of the role of the teacher, that's what I said about pre-rehearsal and in-the-moment inspiration. It is a role of the teacher. You never wanted school or here. It corresponds to something very deep in you, this refusal of the disciples. Yes, I refused, I think, it generally still makes your fu, it's that it makes both sides, no one wants to be a good disciple. Me, I don't want to have it. A school is terrible for the very ground reasons. A school takes a long time. We come to manage. For philosophers who make school. Whatever the lives of Gensénia, it's a school. Good, it's not the marade. Les Aides-Gaviens is a school. First of all, it involves terrible settling of accounts, it involves exclusivities, it involves an organization of time. It involves a whole management, I have a school. Me, I attended between the rivalries, between the Aides-Gaviens, France, and in Mané-Parbau, and the Aides-Gaviens-Bel, I have some velances, such at the utro-knife. All that is abominable, at least for me, it introduces us. There is a field. And then, I have other, I mean, even at the level of ambitions, to be... Yeah, to be a school head, to see the camp, the camp, the camp, it's a head of school too. But it's terrible, it gives a lot of worries. You have to be made up at Vélic, to be all that, and then, I hate it, for my project, I hate it. It's school, it's the opposite of movement. It's... I'll take a very simple example, surrealism, it's a school. Settlement of the account, court, exclusion, etc., Breton, he made a school. D'ardat was a movement. Me, me too, I had an ideal, I'm not saying that I succeeded, it would be to participate in a movement. That, yes, being in a movement, yes. But even being the head of a school seems to me... it doesn't seem at all inspiring, viable. So... A movement where the ideal is finally. If you want, it's not to have notions, to guarantee and sign, or that the tenis prepètes, for me, there are two important things. The relationship one can have with students is... Learning them again that they should make them happy with their loneliness. They don't arrive... They don't arrive without heroes, a little communication, without soil, etc., that's why they want schools. But... They won't be able to do anything but their loneliness. So it's teaching them the good of their loneliness. It's reconciling them with their loneliness, then you have to... That, then that, that, that's my role as a teacher. And then, the second aspect, but it's more or less the same, I don't want to launch notions that they make schools, I would like to launch notions of concepts that pass through the course, which become, not at all, I want not to say, which become something ordinary, but which become current ideas, that is to say manageable in several ways. So that can only happen if I also address solitary people who will twist notions in their own way, without serving as they need. So all that is notions of movement and not notions of school. And do you think that the university today the era of the great professors has revolutionized, it doesn't seem to be going very strong as a university? Me, I don't have much idea about it, but I left, a moment that was terrifying, I didn't understand how the teachers could still make moves. That means, they had become managers. The university is current and very clear policy. And the capacity will be to be a place of orchestra. It is one with the coming into force of discipline which has nothing to do with university disciplines. My dream would be for universities to remain places of research and that alongside universities there would be more schools. During technical schools, we learn accounting, we learn computer science, etc. But the university even intervenes in computer science in accounting only at the level of research. And there would be agreements, all the agreements you want between a school and a university. The school, seeing these students, pursues orchestra lessons, yes. But as soon as we bring school subjects, university and the damned into the university, it's more a place of orchestra. And one is increasingly eaten by management stories, the number of meetings, etc., etc., university. That's why I don't quite see how teachers can't give a course. So I guess, I guess they all do the same, or they don't even anymore. But maybe I'm wrong, maybe they keep doing great. But finally, the expectation seems to me to be the disposition of the research of the university, the rise of the non-creative disciplines in the university, not of which are not research disciplines. They call me russas. The adaptation of the university to the labor market. But it's not the role of the university, it wasn't in the job market, it's the role of the schools.
