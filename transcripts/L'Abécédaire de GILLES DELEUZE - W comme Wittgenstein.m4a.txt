So not either W and W? No, nothing, W. If it's Vidganstein, I know it's nothing for you, but I'm dumping you. No, I don't want to talk about that. For me it's a philosophical catastrophe, it's the very type of NÃ©cole, it's a regression of all philosophy. There are massive regressions of philosophy. It's very sad to do it, Vidganstein. They screwed up a system of a field where all you are trying to do is do something new. It's poverty history in great time, it's philosophy. It is not skin to describe this danger. It's a danger that comes back, it's not the first time it's come back. It's serious, especially who are bad guys, Vidganstein and Castou. If they win, then there will be a philosophical assassination. It's assassination philosophies. It's serious. Yes, it takes great care.
