It's a concept that you hold dear because it's a spinosist concept and it's spinosat that made joy a concept of resistance and life. Avoiding sad patients and living with joy to be at our most powerful. So you have to do resignation, bad conscience, guilt, all the sad affects that exploit near judge and psychoanalyst. So we can see exactly what could please you in all of this. So first I would like you to distinguish joy from sadness and for this spinosat and necessarily for you. Is the distinction of this spinosat first totally latian? Did you find anything the day you read this? Yes, because these are the texts then most extraordinarily loaded with affects, loaded with affects in this spinosat. But that comes down to saying, it brings me together, that plies a lot, but that comes down to saying, joy is everything that consists in filling a power. You experience joy when he fills you up, when he gives you power. So what is it ? We will come back to our examples. I conquer, however little it may be a piece of color, I draw a little into the color. Against the joy that it can be joy. That is to fulfill a power, to effect a power. I have a power fill. So it is the minus power that is equivocal. On the contrary, what is sadness? It is when I am separated from a power that, rightly or wrongly, or rightly or wrongly, I believed myself capable of. I can do that. But the circumstances either, it was not allowed, or it was not possible. So there is sadness. One would have to say that all sadness is the effect of a power over me. It's a nice to talk about. It was a nice to talk. We were at the report, finally, to the opposition joy sadness. Yes, I say with, you are something of his power. It's always good. That's what the fidots say. Well, there are problems there. We need clarification. There is no evil power. No bad power. What is bad is not. What is bad or good, what is bad, should be said is the lowest seed of potency. And the lowest seed of power is power. I mean the wickedness of secoires is prevented. Someone to do what can. The wickedness of secoirs, it is a sin, one to cause his power to fail. So that there is no evil power, there are evil powers. And maybe all power is evil by matue, not necessarily, maybe it's too easy to say that. But it is indeed the idea of the confusion of powers and power. It is ruinous because power always separates people who are submissive from those who pave the way. It is good that it is from there that by this binozane, she makes use of the sadness and the links to the loans, to the ties, to the judges, to the judges. It's superpetually people, it's not who it's not. Their subject of what they can, which prohibits powerful effectuations. You were doing a lujon earlier, it's very curious, you were doing a lujon. Donnich's reputation for anti-Sebitism. This is clear, because this is a very important question. There are texts of illusions, very disturbing, if we actually read them, if we don't read them as we suggested earlier to read the philosophers, if we read them a little too quickly. And it is very curious that all the texts, where they attack the Jewish peoples, what do they reproach the Jewish peoples for illusions? What are they doing that we said, or is it a lujon, it's very interesting, because they reproach the Jewish peoples. They accuse him today of very precise conditions of having invented a character who did not exist before him and who is the character of the priest. To my knowledge, there are never less texts of illusions, which one serves in the Jews, on the mandu, of an attack. It is always an attack on the Jewish peoples who invented the priest. Well, to believe that according to him in the other social formations, there can be sorcerers, scribes, it is not the same thing as the priest. They made this astonishing adventure and Nietzsche, at the same time as he has a great philosophical force, Nietzsche did not admire what hates. He says, it's an unbelievable adventure to have invented the priest. It is something prodigious. And then, it is made the link straight from the Jews to the Christians. Calling himself, it's not the same type of priest. But the Christians, then, conceive of another type of priest and will continue in the same way the character of the priestess. That is to say how concrete philosophy is. I mean, I would say Nietzsche, and to my knowledge, the first philosopher to invent creating the concept of a priest. And starting from there to have posed a fundamental problem, in what consists the capacity sits as much. What is the difference between the power to sit as much with the power to believe in y'a, with the power, etc.? This is a question that is still quite topical, for example. Foucault perhaps so much before his edge, with fully recovered with his own means, there, there would be to resume our whole beginning on what does it make to continue, to prolong philosophy, what does it do ? In fact, it is that Foucault also proposes post-storal power, a new concept which even deviates from that of Nietzsche, but which interlocks with that of Nietzsche. This is where there is a history of thought. And what is it in him priest? And in what is there sadness? It is because, according to Nietzsche, in any case, the priest is defined by this. It is because he advances the idea that men are in a state of infinite debt. That they have an infinite debt. Before, there were many stories of debt. We know it, but Nietzsche preceded all ethnologists. That, ethnologists would have a lot of interest in reading Nietzsche. Because they have, when ethnologists discovered long after Nietzsche, that in so-called primitive societies, there were exchanges of debt. And that, perpetually, it worked not so much by barter, as we believed, but that it worked by piece of debt. A tribute that has a date next to the tribute name, etc., etc., yes, but it was finished debt blocks. We received and then we returned. The difference with barter is that there was time. This is the reality of time. It's a different rendering. It's huge. Then it rembèère, the date is first in relation to the exchange. These are all philosophical issues. The changes, the date, the date which is first in relation to the exchange, it is a great philosophical concept. I say philosophical, because Nietzsche said he was good at having ethnologists. But as long as the debts, or decrees trust me, man can free himself from them, when the Jewish priest, a vote the idea, by virtue of an alliance of an infidel debt, of the Jewish people vis-à-vis live by his God, when the criteria take it up in another form, the idea of the infidi debt, the original epic, it is a character seen as a very curious priest, of which it is up to philosophy to make the concept and intends that 'é, I'm not saying that philosophy is necessarily attaï, but within the framework of an author like spinosa, who had already sketched out an analysis of the priest, of the Jewish priest, in particular in the line from heology to politics, which we see, it happens that philosophical concepts are real characters, that's why philosophy is so concrete. Doing the concept of the priest is like another type of artist, fresh the painting of the priest, the portrait of the priest, the concept of the priest led by spinosa and then by niche. And finally by Foucault, I say that it formed an exciting line. Me, for example, I would also like to eat lapdans, see a little, what this power goes through, they say it works more, you have to see what it has taken over. For that, what I was saying, in effect, the analysis instrument is a new avatar of past toral power. Now, in a definite way, it's not the same thing as the tie rods, the priests, you mustn't confuse everything, but they have, at least, to hold their power from the sad passions they inspire in men. Type, repent in the name of infinite debt, you are obligated to infinite debt, etc. That's where they have power. It is in that power is always an obstacle put to the effectuation of powers. While I would say all power the sad ones. Even if those who have power over them enjoy a lot of voice, it is a sad joy. There are sad joys, it is a sad joy. On the other hand, joy is the effectuation of powers. Again, I don't know, I don't know power, but I don't know power. The small bottom is a power. He must rejoice in his soul, but it is not to beat the houses that he rejoices. It is to be, it is to rejoice in being what one is. That is to say, to have arrived there-honor. So it's not self-joy. It is not a joy, it is not being satisfied with oneself. Not at all, it is not the pleasure of being satisfied with oneself. It is the pleasure of conquest, as you are told. But the conquest, what happened, is to see people again. Conquest is present, not being conquered by color. Yes, that is a conquest. There is joy. Even if it turns out badly, because in these stories of power, when you conquer a power, when you conquer something in a power, it runs the risk of being too powerful for the person himself. So here we go. 8 y. So, a small follow-up question. You, that there is the chance of copings with infinite debt. When it's done that you complain from morning to night and you have a great defender of the complaint and the éligie? It's a personal question. The eligia, yes, I have always found, first the eligia, it is one of the two sources of poetry. Finally, it is one of the main sources of poetry. This is the big complaint. So, there is a lot, there would be a whole story of the éligie affair. I don't know if it was made, but it's very interesting, because there is the complaint of the prophet. Prophetism is quite paradable. The prophet is the one who complains, who says, but why did God choose me there? What I did for her chosen by God? In sense, she contracted to the priest. So he complains, he complains, about what is happening to him. Meaning, it's too big for me. That's the complaint. What is happening to me is too big for me. So if we accept that the complaint, it doesn't always show, it's not high, there was, there was, there was that I still have pain only one. That's it too. But the one who complains, which means it, the old lady who complains about cerimatism, she means, in fact, that she can forgive herself a kind of it that is too big for me to bear. It's too big for me. If we look at history, it's very interesting, wrong and legitimate, indeed, the elegit first, it's the deaf of poetry, there, it's only Latin poetry. And the poets of the complexion, the great poets of the complexion. I knew him in, I read a lot in the past, Catule, Tibers, all that, they are prodigious poets. What is elegit? Me, I think it's the expression of someone who is temporarily out of step, who no longer has any social status. For that, it is interesting. A good old soplan, yes, okay. A guy on the galleys, this full. It's not sadness at all. It's a very long thing, it's their vindication, the board that is amazing. And there is worship in the board. It's like a prayer, the plank. The complaints of popular, you have to put all the complexion. I said it to the plank of the prophet. The plate, the of a subject you know well, since you worked on it wrongly, the plate of the hypochondriac. The hypochondriac is someone who complains, and the intensity of the complaints, the hypochondriac are beautiful. Why am I a liver? Why am I a vate? 'Cause it hurts me, that's why am I? Why am I disorganized? Why is that? Why am I... Finally, the board is sublime. The popular board, completes it. The complete of the sasra, the complete which is sung by the people. I say, it's the socially excluded who are in trouble. There is a Chinese specialist. Not big Chinese, I believe, whose name is Tecaille, who has done tutes on Chinese elegy. And it shows that, in my memory, it shows that Chinese elegy is anime before everything else. The one who no longer has a social status, that is to say, the slave to Franche. Just a slave. He still has such an unhappy status. He can be very unhappy, he can be beaten all you want. He still has a social status. When he is a Franche, there are times when there is no social status for the Franche slave. He is beyond everything. It must be a bit like that, the liberation of blacks in America with the police on slavery. When he abolished slavery, there was no statute yet. He finds himself excluded. If we interpret stupidly, they sent well, they come back. They have broken status, they are excluded from any community. So, at that time, is the big plant. Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya. But it's not the pain they have. It's a kind of luck. It is a political source. Me, I wouldn't have been a philosopher, or I would have been a woman. I wanted to be a mourner. The mourner, it's true. The plant rises. It's an art. And then, it didn't matter a bit. That means, you don't charge a plan. I don't touch myself. It's a bit like overly polite people. And me, too polite people, and I would like to be more and more polite, it's not touching me. I don't touch myself. So it's a kind of... The plant is the same thing. Don't complain, I'll take care of it. But by changing it yourself, you transform the plant. Again, this is what happens to me and too big for me. That's the plant. So, me, I mean every morning. What happens to me and too big for me is joy. In a way, it's the joy at the cut, but that we are careful to hide. There are people who don't really like people to be happy. It must therefore be hidden in a kind of flat. But this plant is not only joy, because it is a time a foline that is study in my facts. Perform a power, well maybe she took. Am I not going to leave my skin there? As soon as we perform a power, I even talk about things too. It's a bit simple that a shepherd who approaches color. Won't he leave his skin there? But literally, after all, I don't believe it's done in literature, to say that the way Van Gogh went into color has more to do with his madness than with stories of psychoanalysis, and that's relationships with color that were also tapped, in any case. Something is about to break me. It's too big for me. It's too big for me. In misfortune or in happiness, I really don't have the time.
