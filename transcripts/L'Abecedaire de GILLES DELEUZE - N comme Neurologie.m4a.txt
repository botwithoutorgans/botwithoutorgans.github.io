So she is neurology and brain. Don't relige, it's a robot. Oh, it's very hard, a neurology. It's true that neurology always goes easy, but why? What goes through someone's head when they have unity? I prefer when he has unity, when he has no idea, it happens a bit like in an electric ticket. What's going on ? How does it communicate to the terror of the head? What happens before talking about communication, etc. Already, how did it communicate in the head? Or the head of an idiot, I mean, it's the same thing also someone who has unity or an idiot. All the same, it does not take this step by preformed path by association. Absolutely. Well, what's going on here? If we knew, I'm going to have the impression that we would understand everything. That interests me, for example. And the electric solutions are lightly vanilla. Two ends of error, one in the brain can very well come into contact. This is even what is called electrical processes in the synapses. And then, in other cases, a much more complex perhaps where it's discontinued. And where there is a flaw in it. And me, I have the impression that the brain is full of strong. And that it jumps, and that it jumps in a probabilistic regime. That there are probability ratios between two sequences. That it is much, much more. Some. Very, very certain. Internal communications, within the same brain, are basically at certain. Subject to laws of probability. But what makes me think of something? That is to say we can always say these eyes, the questions, he has inventory, it is the association of ideas. 15. It's still. So, one must almost wonder. For example, a concept is given to a painting, a work of art contemplated, look. It takes almost trying to make my brain map. It matches. There would be continuous communications, discontinuous communications from one point to another. There is one thing that struck me a lot. So there, we might join what you wanted. What struck me a lot was a story that physicists use a lot, under the name of the baker's transformation. You take like a square of kneading machine and you pull them, requiring them, peturabat, you do a re-drawing, etc., etc., you do your transformations. And at the limit of X transformation, of completely contiguous points. Inevitably, it is led to be contrary very very distant. And there are no distinct points which have the sequence of X transformation, we are at contiguous points. I say to myself, we are looking for something in his head. Aren't there shuffling of stalks, here there aren't tricks or two points at such a baman, at such a state of my idea, there are two points, I don't see how the approach and communicate. And then at the end of this transformation, the valleys are in there next to each other. All that. I would almost say a concept between a concept or a work of art. It has returns to produced the mind and to mechanism at its core. There are resemblances which are so very very moving that I just want to feel badly about the question how do we think or what differs from it and the question. And at the same time to think and to brain absolutely mixed. I would say I believe more if you have the future of the molecular biology of the brain than the future of computer science or theory and any theory of communication. And you always made room for 19th grade psychiatry, which was capable of neurology and brain science over psychoanalysis. And you have always maintained this priority of psychoanalysis over psychoanalysis. And absolutely. And it continues? Yes Yes Yes Yes. I said a while ago the pharmacy which also has it having relations with them. Pharmacy, its positive action on the brain and the cerebral structures that could be found at the malecular level in cases of schizophrenia, all that interests me. We came more certain than the apsychiatrix and the dualists. And there it is a question of method because you are not in secret. In fact, this is a question extended to science. You are rather at the ideal rate when you don't have a neurobiology journal or if you don't have a scientific journal. You're not very good at math. Contrary, we make off that you studied, well that we were mathematics graduates, it's that we were good in mathematics, hypnosis, it's an idea to say it, is very good mathematics. How do you manage to read when you have an idea and you need something that interests you and you don't necessarily understand everything? How are you doing? I already have something that comforted me a lot. I am convinced that there are several readings of the same thing. And when already in philosophy, that I strongly believe in it, there is no need to be a philosopher to read philosophy. There is that philosophy is susceptible, only susceptible, that it needs readings at the same time. A non-philosophical reading of philosophy is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, there would be no beauty in a philosophy. That is to say that non-specialists, read philosophy. Non-philosophical nature of philosophy, does nothing. She has her sufficiency. Simply, it is a reading. That may not go for all philosophy. I do not see the possibility of a non-philosophical reading of 40, for example. But he is a funder. I mean that a country in the ispinence, not at all possible that a march in read, it is a funder. A niche is even more self-evident. All the philosophers I love are like that. So, I believe very in no need to understand. It's as if... understanding is a certain level of reading. But it's a bit as if you were telling me to appreciate, for example, Gaugat or a large painting. You still need to know about it. Obviously, you have to know about it, it's better. But that there are also extremely authentic, extremely powerful, extremely violent emotions. In a total ignorance of painting, it is obvious that someone can believe himself. Like a real shot of your air, a painting, and not knowing but nothing about the painting, even. Someone can be extraordinarily loved by music and or by such a musical work, without knowing a word. Me, for example, I am extraordinarily loved by Loulou. By your bag, yes. I'm not even talking about the concert you, but Morgan, no, I didn't laugh at him, maybe who loved me the most in the world. Well, I know well that it would be better that it is even better to have a competent perception. But I said that everything that matters in the world is susceptible to a double, in the realm of the spirit and susceptible to a double reading. Provided that the double reading is not something you do randomly, as an autodidate. It's something we do from these problems that come from elsewhere. I mean, it's as philosophers that I have a non-musical perception of music and that for me it can be extraordinarily moving. Likewise, it is as a musician, as not as this that, it is that the who can have a non-philosophical reading of philosophy. If there is not this second reading which is not even second, if there are not two readings at the same time, it is like the two wings of a bird, if one is not very good, like the two wings of a bird. If there are not two readings at the same time, even a philosopher must learn to read a great philosopher not philosophically. The typical example for me is that it's once again Spillons-en. To see Spillons-en, paperback and then read it like that. Well, in my opinion, we have as many emotions as at a great musical work and in a certain way, the question is not to understand. But in my courses, I'm sure that the courses I did, but it's not so obvious that people sometimes understand and sometimes don't. And we're all like that in a book, sometimes we understand, sometimes we don't. So I come back to your science question then. That, I think, is really... Which means, in a way, we are always at the cutting edge of our ignorance. And that's where you have to settle. You have to settle down to the point of your knowledge, or to the point of your ignorance, it's the same thing to have something to say. If I wait to know what I am going to write, and if I wait to know it and to know... There, there, if I wait to know what I am talking about, and I will always have to wait for what I will say in a canadere top. If I risk, by that, if I also settle down and if I speak sarcastically about what I don't know, it's another absentee from integrating. But I'm talking about this very border that separates knowledge from non-knowledge. It's here. I mean, that's where you have to sit to have something to say. So, turning for me, it's the same. And the confirmation at the JV is that I've always had reports with scholars and not time. They never took me for knowledge, they don't think I understand much, but they tell me it works. Finally, a small donation, no, they walk each other. When I tighten, not z'en, simply it would be necessary... You do not want that I fissons if my zécoche, it is not what to call that. If I give an example, then I'm going to give an example of it all very sand. Here is a herdsman whom I love as much as born water. What is born water? What if I... really, I seek to sum up in the formed, what is born water? He notices a prodigious thing. When I said, so that takes us back to the beginning, what is it to have an idea? What is the idea of born water? The idea of born water is that... light forms figures itself. It is that there are figures of light. It's very new, maybe in others, that long before we had this people? If there appeared born water, it is because we tried this creation of figures which are figures formed by light, figures of light. There are no figures of light. And not at all which is very different. Aspects that light takes on when it encounters an object. This is how he detaches himself from any object, which makes a pasture that no longer has objects. And I'm not going to have him say very nice things to him, he says when he just revels in cubism. But finally, his donkeys had succeeded in breaking the object. There is breaking the fruit bowl. And now the cubists spend their time wanting to re-school it. Therefore, what counts to eliminate the object, is enough that the rigid figures, with the geometric figure, figures of pure light. That's one thing. Pictorial fanning and selling of the onin. So I don't know the dates, it doesn't matter. There is a way or an aspect of relativity, the theory of relativity. I just don't have enough, maybe I don't need. If you don't need to know much, it's being, they say, hottodidin who is dangerous. But we don't need to know much. I know just like that that one of the aspects of relativity is precisely instead of having submitted. How to say, geometric lines. No, instead of having submitted, the lines of light, the line followed by the light. The lines of light, to the geometric line, starting with the oblique experience to the sound, it is the reversal. It is the lines of light that will condition the geometric lines. The advice scientifically is a considerable reversal. It will change everything, since the line of light will not at all the constancy of the geometric line to exchange everything. I'm not saying it's the whole thing, it's the aspect of relativity that gets the most out of the experience of mechanism. I'm not going to say oner, apply relativity. I will celebrate the meeting between a pictorial attempt and a scientific attempt that must be unrelated to the other. I was saying the same thing, so I'll take an example. Just that Roman spaces are not beyond me. I don't know well. I know just enough to know that it is a space that is being built, piece by piece. And whose connections between pieces are not ready to be determined. But for quite another reason, I need a concept of space that doesn't become a connection and that's not ready to be determined. I'm not going to spend 50 years of my life trying to understand himane because when I'm over 50, I won't be advanced in my philosophical concept. And I will also hands. And I see a strange space that everyone knows as space in a braising film where space is rarely global where space is built piece by piece. We see a piece of space, for example a piece of cells in the condemned man, the cell in my vague memory and never seen in its entirety, yet it is a small space. I'm not talking about his custody, we prick him, everything is prodigious. They are small pieces of space that connect. So, we are almost determined why? And that's why it will be manual, hence the importance of the chews and pressures. It's the mask that goes. And indeed, in the pique pourquête, it is the speed with which the infegres to the intuces and the stolen object pass that will determine the sale connections of small spaces. Nor am I going to say that Bresson applies to the Rizmanian space. I say, there can be an encounter between a philosophical concept, a scientific notion and an aesthetic percept. And wow, perfect. I say, in science, I believe, I know just enough to evaluate encounters. If I knew more, I would do science, not philosophy. So. So, at the limit, I speak well of what I do not know. But I talk about what I don't know, based on what I know. Besides, it's all a matter of... I don't know tact. You don't have to fool around. You don't have to have the time to know when you don't know. And... Again, just like I've had encounters with pasta, well these are the best days of my life. I had some encounter not, not a physical encounter. I wrote, I have the encounters with pasta, the greatest entreu, and it is in size, in size, in size, in sick. Yes, there is something and there is something. I don't know the level of the compliment. He doesn't know me, he just had to pay compliments to someone like me. And we don't know each other. There is something happening. What was badly met, squared the obese? Me, I've never done theatre, I've never understood anything about theatre. You have to believe that there was something going on too. There are people of science. Also who does it work for? I've known mathematicians who there, when they were kind enough to read what I'm doing, they said, for us, it fits absolutely. No, it's bad, because I seem to get a kind of satisfaction, out of it being quite naughty, but that's to answer the question. For me, the question was not... Do I know a lot of science or not, can I learn a lot. The important thing is not to read nonsense. It is to establish these eco. It is a phenomenon of listening between a concept, a percept, a function, since the sciences do not proceed with concepts, perhaps proceed from functions. It was garment, I need rymanes spaces. Yes, I know it requires, I don't know what it would be, but that's enough.
