So exit the universals, it has nothing to do with philosophy? Yes, no, it has nothing to do. Not his directly had and seen, that's travels. And that is the demonstration that a concept becomes unparadox. Because you invented a notion, a concept, we can say that he named hymisms. And you are the journeys. We can make this revelation at that time, we maintain, you are the trips. Why are you having the trips? I don't have the travels, the conditions for a poor intellectual to travel. Maybe if I will travel otherwise, I loved travel. But I am the other intellectuals. What it means to travel, it means to go to a conference at the other end of the Hu-Duman, if need be. And with all that entails before and after, by the befores with people who welcome you kindly, by the afters with people who have listened to you kindly, by talking, talking, talking. So it's the opposite of travel, intellectual travel. Go to the good wind of to talk about what to do at home, and to have people before to talk and see people after to talk. It's a monstrous journey. So that said, it's true that I have no sympathy for travel. But it's not a principle, I don't pretend to be right about the thank you. But for me, if you want, I'll say what's in the journey. On the one hand, it always has a small side of false structures. That, I would say, is the first aspect. What kind of me is for me, only for me. What makes travel antipathetic to me? First reason is that it's a cheap break. And I totally feel what he said general. This is not a trip to make a real break. If you want engroup, do something else. Finally, what do we see? People who travel, they travel a lot. Afterwards, they have her even proud, they say it's to find a father. There are great reporters who write books about it. They have done everything, they have made the life of the soul. The Afghan, in all that one wants, he says to the brake of me. They passed these to be the archer of the device. It's for help. The trip is approached at a very short distance. So well, well, I say to myself, no, it's not okay. The second reason, it seems to me that there is a... So very touched by an admirable phrase, as always from baquettes, which makes one of these characters say more or less, I'm quoting badly, it's better said than that. It's... We're stupid all the same, but not to the point of traveling for pleasure. So, at this moment, this sentence does not seem perfectly satisfactory to me. Me, I'm stupid, but not to the point of traveling for pleasure, it's still not. Ah good. Then, on the third aspect of the trip, I mean, so you said, normal, yes. I've always been fascinated by names, but that's previously because names are people who don't travel. What travel are the emigrants. There may be extremely respectable people, who are forced, traveled. Emigrants, that, that, is a field of travel, then. So there is no question of missing each other, because these are sacred journeys. It's forced trips, it's trips. Okay, that... All right. But the names, there is a journey not, what. The names, therefore, contrary to the letter, he remained mobile. That is to say, all the name specialists, they say, it's because they don't want to leave. It's not if it spits on the ground, because they cling to their ground. The orcterus becomes deserted and so clings, they can only nommadis and in their land. It is strong to want to stay on their land, which they name. So, in a sense, one could say, nothing is more immobile than a nomad. Nothing travels less than a nomad. It's not if they don't want to leave that they're nommad. So, that's why they're absolutely so undercut. And then, finally, afterwards, it's the last aspect of the trip, which isn't very... There, I found it, there is a phrase of prowess, very beautiful, finally, what is it? what do we do when we travel? We always check something, what. We check that the color we dreamed of is indeed there. To which he adds, it is very important. He says, a bad alarm clock, and someone who won't see if the color he dreamed of is really there. But a good alarm clock, you have to go check it out. See if the color is there, is there. So, that, I say to myself, that's a good conception of travel. But also no... It's a fantastic variation. No, at the same time, there are trips. There are trips that are real ruptures. For example, the life of the oclesio currently seems to be something where there is certainly a break. Lorenz. Lorenz. Lorenz, it's... Yes, Lorenz, yes, that, I... There are too many great writers for whom I have put against admiration, and who have a sense of travel Stevenson, I tell you travel , I tell you, Stevenson. It's not nothing, all that. So, if I say there, no generalization. I say, for my own account, someone who doesn't like travelling, it must be for these four reasons. The field of travel is linked to your natural slowness. No, Mr Council very long journeys. Yes, in any case, I don't need to eat. Me, all the intensities that I have are immobile intensities. Intensities are distributed either in space, or else in other systems, not necessarily in exterior space. Me, I assured you that when I read a book that I admire that I find beautiful, or when I hear music that I find beautiful, really, then I have the feeling of going through such states that never has a trip to Paris given me emotion. So why would I go looking for those emotions that don't suit me very well, when I have them for me more beautiful in immobile systems, like music or like philosophy. There is a geomusic, a geophilosophy, it's deep countries. It's more my countries, yes. foreign land. These are my lands foreign to me. So I don't find them in travel, no. We made allowance for the illustration that the movement is not about moving, but you still traveled a little bit, you were in Lebanon, since you gave conferences in Canada or the USA. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I do that, but I mean I was always doing it, now I don't anymore because I have... But I never should have done all that. I overdid it. Then, I walked to myself there. Now I can walk less well. It doesn't even matter anymore. I even walked well. Yes, I remember, I was on foot, me, from morning to evening, without knowing where I was going. There, I'm afraid that in the middle, there is life, he's on foot, but it all ended well.
