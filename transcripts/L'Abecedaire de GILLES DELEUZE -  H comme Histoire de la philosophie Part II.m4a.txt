So I'll take a second example that has nothing to do with diversity. Long after, there is a philosopher called Amnitz who makes and puts forward an extraordinary concept, an extraordinary concept, to which he will give the name of monad, who chooses a complicated technical word, monad and person. And we're made up of concepts that always have something a little crazy, this mother who wouldn't be like air, in the other case, the pure idea, all that, and there's something a little mad. And indeed the hand of the same, nor is there a designated sound, a subject, someone, you at least, insofar as it expresses the totality of the world, and that, expressing the totality of the world, it expresses clearly that a small region of the world, its territory, we have seen, we have already spoken of the territory, its territory or what the Amnitz calls its department. So a subjective unit that expresses the whole world, but he clearly expresses that a region than a department of the world, that's what he calls a mommade. So there too, it's a concept, he creates it, this concept does not exist before him. We say but why, why he created it, what... Very nice, it's going to be why do that, why say that, rather against luck. You have to find the problem, and it's not that he's hiding the problem, but if you don't look, you won't find it. And that's the charm of the Ir of philosophy, it's as much the charm and it's as amusing as the Ir, when he takes novels or looks at paintings, it's prodigious, that what do we notice, if we read it? Indeed, he did not create the concept of mandate for the pleasure, for his pleasure. But for other reasons it poses a problem which is what? Namely that everything in the world only exists bent. That's why I made the pound on him which was called the other fold. He experiences the world as a set of things that are eye-bent on each other. We can go back why does he live the world this way? What is happening? Just like for platons earlier, maybe the answer. At the time, did things bend? Does more than now? Well, we don't have time. What matters is this idea of a world that is folded and everything is a fold of a fold. We have the jabets to something completely unfolded. And matter is made of withdrawal into itself. And things of the mind, perceptions, feelings are bent in the soul. It is precisely because the perceptions, the feelings, the ideas, are folded in a soul that this concept of a soul which expresses the whole world is built there. That is to say in which the whole world lies bent. So, pressure, we mean, what is a bad philosopher? What is a great philosopher? A bad philosopher is someone who does not invent a concept. Who uses says ready-made. Opinions are wrong. He does not do philosophy. He says, here is what I take. Well, we still know a lot of them now, but he had them all the time. Opinions, good. He does not invent a concept. And it does pose the real fate of the good problem. It poses no problem. So, writing the history of a philosopher is this long apprenticeship, where one learns. Or one is really an apprentice in this double field. The constitution of problems, the creation of concepts. There is no, if you will, what does he do? What is he doing there? Thought can be silly logs etc. People are talking. But we know I resent what the problem is themselves. Not only does it create no concept. They put opinions, but in addition we know I want what problem he is talking about. I mean, we know the questions, but if I say does God exist? It's not a problem, does God exist? I don't know of them problems. Yes, he is the problem. Why do I remember this question? What is the problem behind this? People want to ask the question. Ah, do I believe in God? Don't I believe in God? But does anyone care? Who believes in God? Who believes in God? What about these... Is that why they say that? That is to say what problem it answers. And what concept are they going to manufacture? What concept of God are they going to fabricate? If you don't have a concept or a problem, you're solving stupidity, that is to say, you're not doing philosophy. But he thought how fun philosophy is. The history of philosophy, since it's... It's a sincere part of the history of philosophy. Find... It's not so difficult what you have to do when you find yourself in front of a big picture, in front of a musical confession. Precisely, we return to Gauguin and Van Gogh, since you evoked their tremblings of fear before approaching the color. What happened? When did you move from the history of philosophy and philosophy to your own philosophy? This is it. Without doubt, the history of philosophy... Had given me my life at the price of things. That is to say, I felt more capable of approaching what is color in philosophy, that is to say. But why does this arise? I mean why does philosophy not stop? Why doesn't he stop? For example, why is there still philosophy today? There is not so a place to always create concepts. So this notion of creation of the concept, it is the publicity which is part of it. He creates concepts, with computers, all that. There is a whole language that has been stolen from philosophy. So it creates a question? Communication, you have to be creative, you have to create concepts. But opposite what they call concept, do they call creating a psychological thing? There is no need to insist. It remains the land of philosophy. It is still relevant today. I've never been touched by people who say the death of philosophy, of the past of philosophy, of philosophies that say such complicated things. But, it never kept, never touched because I tell myself well, what does all this mean? As long as there is a need to create concepts, there will be philosophy, since that is what defines. And that the concepts do not expect us everything. They have to be created. So, and they are feared function of problem. The problems will evolve. So there is any place. So, of course, you can be a plateodic, you can be a Dixian, even today, in 1989, you can do all that. We can be aware. What does it mean? It means that we consider that some, by all in doubt, that some problems posed by Plato, remain valid, have undergone certain transformations. Because we have, we are plateodics. And we still use plateodic concepts. If we pose problems of a completely different nature, in my opinion, there is no case where there is not among the great philosophers, one or more great philosophers, who is something to tell us about the problems transformed today. But to do philosophy is to create new concepts based on the problems that arise today. So the last aspect of this question, it would obviously be good, what is the evolution of problems? What does it insure? So, I would always say to myself historical, social forces, yes, okay. But there is something more professional. It's very mysterious and then we wouldn't have time. But I very much believe in a kind of becoming of thought. Evolution of thought, which means that we not only don't pose the same problems, but we don't pose them in the same way. A problem can be posed in several successive ways and there is an urgent call, a great grander, which calls on the need always to create, to recreate new concepts. There is a history of thought which would be bread, which would be bread to sociological influence or to influence. There is everything to become of thought, which is always very mysterious, which we would have to be able to define, which means that perhaps today we don't think in the same way as... 100 years ago , we don't think today, well, I hear processes of thoughts and elipses of thoughts and thought, it has its history. There is a history of pure thought. So doing philosophy for me is exactly that. It has only ever had one function, in my opinion, philosophy. She had that she needs to be thought since she has her function. 4, 1. It's still. She is towing a mile. Yes, you meant that... Yes, how is a problem across the pond? It must... It's already not... That is to say that the thought has come. And no, that... Ivanka is there with LÃ©do, a meeting. I know that from a newer olhar orang it is that the mind is mistaken, avoid that the mind is mistaken, as one avoids laughter. And then there is very the angliation and in the 18th century begins to put a different problem. It might look the same and in fact it is not the same at all. It is no longer to denounce the laughter to denounce the isles-lusions. The idea that the mind falls and even surrounds and illusion, much more than it produces itself. Not only does it fall into errors, but it produces islands-lusions. It's the whole 18th century movement, 18th century philosophers, denunciation, superstition, etc. But it could look a little like the 17th century. And in fact the problem that begins to set entirely new. So we can say there too, there are social reasons, etc. But there is also a story of the secret of thought which would be fascinating to do. The question is more how to avoid falling into laughter, but how to manage to dissipate the islands-lusions with which the mind surrounds itself. And then in the 18th century. I'm going on purpose to say things so together, so rudimentary in the 18th century. What is happening? As if it slipped and even it did not completely, but it is the more and more. How to avoid, what, the illusion, no. It is more than the mind. But let men, as spiritual creatures, keep talking nonsense. It's more the same thing as the illusion, it's not falling into an illusion, it's how to ward off stupidity. So it's not going to be very clear. I am at the border of philosophy. When the flow-bet, it was at the border of philosophy. The problem of stupidity, beauty of the air, the problem of stupidity is more the same thing as illusion, etc. So we can say there too, it is linked to social developments. For example, the evolution of the bourgeoisie in the 18th century which made the problem of stupidity an urgent problem. Fine, but there is something deeper in these developments, in this kind of history of the problems that thought faces. And each time a problem is posed, there are new concepts that appear. So that if we understand philosophy in this way, creation of concepts, constitution of problem, the problems being more or less hidden, therefore it is necessary to rediscover them, all that. One impresses that philosophy has strictly, but nothing to do with the true the false. It has nothing to do with the real the fake, it's not looking for the truth. Philosophy, it is not nothing to say, each in the truth. If it's about creating concepts, what does that mean? A concept, it is... and constituting a problem is not a matter of truth or falsification, it is a matter of meaning. A problem, well, it has to have a meaning. There are problems that don't make sense. There are issues that make sense. Doing philosophy is constituting problems that have meaning and creating concepts that move us forward in understanding and solving the problem. We are going to come back to two questions that are more specific to you. Oh, it seems to me that I had... Yes. When you redid the history of philosophy with the AÃ¯bnitz last year, was it the same way as you had done it 20 years ago? That is to say before producing your own philosophy? Was it the same way? No, probably not. Probably not, because before, I really used philosophy and the history of philosophy as a way of... Yes, like this kind of essential learning where I only looked for other people's concepts, that is, great philosophers and what problem they answered. It says what there, what I did on the Aibnitz, I... There's nothing vanity in what I'm saying. I have put the 20th century problems which may be the focus of the problem of AÃ¯bnitz once said that I am convinced of the topicality of philosophers. If you want, a great philosopher, to do like him, what does it matter? To do like him is not necessarily to be a disciple of him. To do like him is to prolong his task, to create concepts in relation to those who created him, to submit problems in relation and in evolution with those who created him. So I think that by doing the AÃ¯bnitz, I was more on that path, wait for it, in my first philosophy books, I was at the pre-cut stage there, yes. And you declared there a statement of Spinoza and we can also apply it to Nietzsche, that he linked you to the somewhat hidden and somewhat modest part of the history of philosophy. What did that mean? In that perhaps... we would have the opportunity to come back to it for me. And I believe that we will have the opportunity to come back to it. For me, that means this hidden part, it's people who... they're thinkers who rejected all transcendence. Who rejected all transcendence, it will have to be defined as we will have the opportunity, perhaps, to speak again of transcendence. These are authors who reject all universals, that is to say the idea of concept, there is a universal value, and any transcendence, that is to say any authority that goes beyond the earth and the men. But to come back to what was before, it's the authors of the immannonce. You, you have your books on Nietzsche or Spinoza, a date, that is to say that you are known for your books on Spinoza or on Nietzsche. And yet, one cannot say that you are Nietzsche, nor Spinoza, as one can say, of a platonition or an etian, that which you went through all that, even when it served you as an apprentice, and you I was already from the oisien. We cannot say that you are Spinoza. There, you make me a very great compliment, that is to say if it is true, I am... But you, how did you feel? I always wished, I think indeed that well, had me, I could fail, but I think that I tried to pose problems for my account and to create concepts for my account. Almost to the limit, I would dream of a quantification of philosophy. That means, each philosopher would be assigned a number of magic numbers, according to the number of concepts that he actually created. Will return problems etc. It would have magic numbers, well, cases, shut up, the limit, but that would be interesting. So, obviously, I dare not go there. Me, I might have a very small magic number to know how to create some concepts according to problems. Simply, I said to myself, my boss is that whatever kind of concepts I tried to create, I can tell what problem it answered for me. And to refine? Otherwise, it would be gossip. That's it, but yes, I'm here with a last question, but I have to know what it is absolutely. Oh yes. She is a bit provocative. When you were in 68, in the 68s, or even before, when everyone was explaining Marx, everyone, there was Reich. There was no provocation on your part to turn towards Nid, which was really suspicious of fascism in those years, and to talk about Spinoza and the body, when everyone would have been building their ears with Reich. So history of philosophy, it didn't work as a little provocation too. We're going to do it again because we're at home. Wasn't there a little provocation all the same? No, but it's very linked, did we just say? It's almost the same question. Because, I was looking for even if we were looking for it with Fedix, it was the spirit of a truly immanent dimension of the unconscious. For example, all of psychoanalysis is full of transcendent elements, the law, the father, the mother, or that, you said that there is a manance site that would make it possible to define the unconscious. That, then, is the domain, maybe Spinoza could go further than nobody had been, maybe Nietzsche could also go further than nobody had been. It seems to me not so much provocation, it was that Spinoza and Nietzsche, forming philosophy, perhaps the greatest, I mean, liberation of thought, almost in the sense an explosive. Yes, and perhaps the concepts, the most unusual concepts, because their problems are problems that were a bit modis problems. Then we are not posed, at the time of Spinoza, in any case, certainly, but even at the time of Nietzsche. The problems that we would not have posed too much are what are called rough problems of gold. Alright, so we can move on,
