12 to... A full one. It's like... We can, Jean. We can. Go ahead. So M, it's illness. Here, come. Just after the end point, a series of differences and repetitions, 1968, who was hospitalized for very serious tuberculosis. You who had what there is about the nest, you espis our aques, she is a great ferryman, she is poor health, you have had to live, from now on, 68 with the disease. Did you know if you had tuberculosis for a long time, or did you know if your disease had been there for a long time? Evil, yes, I knew I had something wrong for a long time. But... I think I am when liked by people. I didn't really want to know and then... as people liked, I obviously thought it was cancer, which I was in no hurry, and then... well, I didn't know it was TB, but I knew...until I coughed up blood, yes. So... Me, I am a child, tuberculosis, but before no, it no longer presented any danger, that is to say that there were antibiotics. It was quite serious, 10 years before, or 3 years before, it must have been the beginning, a few years before, I couldn't survive it, but there, there was no longer any problem, in addition, it is a disease that does not involve pain. I can say that... I was very sick, but it is a great privilege, a disease without suffering, a curable disease, without suffering, it is a bit of a disease, that is to say it It's a disease, yes, it's true, but before, I never had an immense health, I would say, I was always very tired. So is the question fascinated enough, someone who proposes, I'm not saying, I'm not talking about the success of the company, but someone who proposes or who loves, who proposes, who has how resumed to think, to try to think, do I believe that the State indeed of a very weak and favorable health? Not at all that one is listening to one's own life, but thinking is all the same, for me, it seems to me to be listening to life. So it's because it's happening, either listening to life, it's so much different, thinking about your own health, but I think that fragile health favors, kind of listening, when I said, it's great height like Laurent de Sous-Py in a, in a way, they saw something too big, so big that... It was too much for them, it's true that you can't think of if you're not already in a field, which is that it doesn't have your frances a bit, that is to say that they make you fragile. Good, good, I have always had a somewhat fragile health effect, and there, that is confirmed from the moment when I was, when I had been tuberculous, I acquired all the rights of a poor health. It was... Yes. It's fine as you say. But your relationship to doctors and medications changed from that moment on, that is to say, you had to see doctors, you had to take medication on a regular basis, and that is like a constraint, it's as if you were telling yourself that doctors don't tell you much. Yes, personally, it's not a question of anyone, because I've always had your crush on Chagomain doctors, high school students. But it is a type of power, or the way in which they manipulate power, in order to also rediscover, one does not know, there is no question already, as if the mentienne is the behaving being, the totality, the tucked over the totality, the way they shackle power appears to me to the gods, these are, they are to the gods, as physicians they are to the gods, I have a great queen for, not for the physicians person contrary, which is often charming, but I have a great queen for medical power and the way doctors use will be able. There is something that delights me, me, and it is at the same time what is unhappy, it is when I arrive as he works more and more with devices, there are tests, it is moreover one of the devices for the patient, and proof of which one has the impression that it has absolutely no interest, except to comfort the endeagnostic to confirm it, but if this demeter will nevertheless be notat there, they are already the endeagnostic that the trials believed, and that she has not just comforted, they play with these trials in an inadmissible way, so what made me happy was each time that I passed or that I was able to pass under to our devices. That is to say that my breath was too thin, could be angist in the same way, or else they couldn't give me, I don't know what it's called, a doctor's grip, we didn't couldn't do it to me. An ecografe, yes, because I also passed under the same, and my joy is that at that time, they are crazy, nothing. I believe that, at that time, they leave their poor patients, they accept very well to be mistaken by agnostics, but they do not accept that they have passed, they do not speak of the like. But if, in, I find that, then they're too stupid, they're too... they're too... how shall I put it? It's... or so when he gets into culture, it's a disaster. Finally, it's a funny, it's his funny Jean-Lémetzard. And my consolation is that it wins a lot of people, but who don't have time to really spend it, we're going to have no time to enjoy it, because there's even a life extremely hard. Well yes, Lémetzard didn't pull much, depending on the personalities, that once he can be exquisite, but in their function, they are... it's really... they treat people like dogs . So that's really the class struggle, because if you're a puriche, they're already much more polite, except in surgery, or there, it's a special case, he surgery, it's still another case. But Lémetzard... Lémetzard, it's not going well, it needs a real strong one, but still. Yes, look, problem. And Lémetz-cammons that you have to take, do you have the time? Yes, I like that, yes. It doesn't piss me off, Lémetz-Cammons, it doesn't piss me off. It tires, they give up. But that put you, it is to take Lémetz-cammons? When there are a lot of them, in my current state, yes, because there are a lot of them, so this little weather, every morning, it has something, it's a foundry food, you know. But I feel like it's very useful too, yes. Very useful, I have always been, even in the domain of the apsyche, who has tried for drugs, for... I have always been for the pharmacy, what. And this fatigue, when we talked about it, which is very much linked to your illness, but which you say was already there before the illness, we think of the text by Glanchot, on fatigue, in the profession. But fatigue is a big part of your life. That is to say that sometimes, you even have the impression that it's an excuse, for many things that bother you. It serves you fatigue, and fatigue has always served you. Me, I think, here it is. When you get hit in that, you come back to the theme of power, what is it... realizing a bit of power, doing what you can do, what's in your power. I mean, it's an old one, it's complex, because what gives me a power, for example fragile health or an illness, can it be about knowing what use to make of it for a through it recover some power. So, and the certain that the disease must be used for something that one remains it. I'm not just talking about life where it has to give a feeling. For me, the disease is not something. It's not an enemy for me. Because it's not something that gives the feeling of death. It is something that eclipses the feeling of life. And not at all in the sense of one plus, when I would like to live, and as if once cured, I'm going to start living. I believe that I anger nothing more object in the world, than what is called a bon vivant. It's a good living. On the contrary, the living great men are very small in health. So I come back to my question. I love the disease, it needles him with a kind of vision of life or of his friend. When I say life vision and life, it's really when. I say see life, but it is crossed by it, way-for. It said that. It gives a vision of life the disease. Life in all its power, in all its beauty. It seemed safe to me. But how to have secondary benefits of the disease, there it is all that, it is that it is necessary to make use of it to be a little more free. You have to use it. It is very unfortunate. Sounds like it's overworking what not to do. This supermanais, if that I worked and achieve any power, it's worth it. But this supermanais socially. I don't understand. I don't understand, but this overwork, because he has too many customers. So we shoot and go. We shoot and leave. There, the disease is. It is indeed, it is this liberated of things between. You can't break free in an ordinary life. Me, personally, I never liked to travel. I have never been able to issue a travel. I respected travel very much. But the fact of having such good health assured me a great deal to decline any trip. Or go to bed too late. It's okay, it was still very hard. Once I was in such poor health, he was involved all the time. And then it was very, very good. And fatigue, you see it as the disease. Fatigue is something else. For me, it's... I did what I could today. I did what I could today. That's it. The day is over. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. The day is over. Fatigue is really biologically the day is over. So she may have to abduct and for other reasons, for social reasons. But fatigue is the biological formulation of what the day is over. You didn't tear yourself to tears. And in that regard, if you take it that way, it's not an unpleasant feeling. It's unpleasant if we haven't done anything. I rejoiced. But otherwise, it's fine. It's good. It is states of fatigue. I have always been sensitive to cotton states. It's cotton fatigue. I'm coming. I'm coming. It stretches you. I'm coming. I'm coming. It stretches you. If he comes, the woman something. That's how it should have a name in music. I don't know what it's called. A cousin. It's a burst of fatigue. I'm going to talk to you a bit beforehand about old age, about your very special relationship with food. Oh, old age. Yes, he is talking about food. First, because the food that brings you, which seems to approach strength and vitality, that is to say the moale, the lobster, brings you very particular food. And you don't really like to eat. You have to feed me. No no no no no. For me to eat another thing. I mean, if I was trying to define quality for me to eat, that's your middle. I believe that's the thing. For me, it's the most boring thing in the world. Drink, but that was good, we did it. Drinking was an extremely interesting thing. Eating never interested me. It bothers me to pay. So eat only heavy. Eating with someone I love changes everything. But it doesn't transform the food. It allowed me to bear to eat. To make it not so boring, though I would say. Fact that I can eat alone, or that's not a lot of people are like that. Eating alone, everyone says, proves how much better eating is, because most people admit it. Eating alone is a humble life agreement. So, that said, of course, but done. But done, it's a bit special to see the universal disgust. I'm not forgotten about other people's cheese. Yes, you don't like doing it. So, you have to... Among people who taste cheese, I'm a fan of being tolerant. There will be no harm or no chasing. Those who have the Jewish cheese, is still supported. This taste which seems more or less of the same type as cannibalism, for example, by the absolute nervous. So, if you're going to be asked, in fact, what to recompose my favorite meal, and there, which for me would be a crazy event, it's true that I always come back to three things. Because there are three things which are not the sublimeques which nevertheless are clean, mented or aunts. It is the tongue, the brain and the brolle. So, I imagine, these are very nourishing things. So, already, to be worth all that, it would be... But there are restaurants, among the few restaurants, among the... I learned it, who serve you brolle, but I can't do anything more eat afterwards, while seizing, it is a lot of the small soft cards. It's quite fascinating, by the way. The brain and then the tongue. So, if I tried to put his high point with what we said, it's a kind of tridity, because we could say, and it's too much indactotes, all that, we could say that the brains , it's God, it's the father, that the brolle, it's the son, since it's the hyoverterium that are little crads, God, it's the skull, the little crads turned, it's is the son. So the bullshit is the son, it's Jesus, and the tongue is the sane, which is the very power of the tongue, or else it could be okay too, I don't know , it's the concept, the brain, the monk, it's the ridge, and the language, it's the percept, we're not going to ask too much why, but I feel that there, these are very tridities.. There you have it, well, that would be it, a fantastic meal for me. Has he aged? Has it happened to me three times at the same time? Maybe a birthday amnimes with fresh meals like that? One done! And don't you intend to eat these three things since you tell us about your old age? That would be too yeah, but it's also important, in old age, yes, but he listens to old age. There is someone who knew how to talk about old age and rebound to Raymond de Vos, the object always a little, but he said the best, I find that old age is an age, but it is splendid, it's splendid, of course, there's a lot of entanglement, we took some nits, but the worst is when someone says to you, no, you're passive, he doesn't understand what that's the complaint. Me, I beach myself, I say, I'm old, I revoke the powers of old age and powers, and here is someone telling me, believe in merit, no, you're not that old, the evening, I I have a slap in the face, I don't know if I do, and it's not a question of telling me, of telling me that I'm in my complete old age, and it's a question of telling myself, but we don't it's not so old, that on the contrary, to tell me, in brothers, yes, but it's pure joy, I mean, joy comes from where, apart from this slowness, if old age is terrible, you mustn't laugh all the same, if old age is terrible, what is it, it's pain and misery, but it's not old age, I mean, a thing that's pathetic, what makes that old age is a sad thing, it is the poor people who have neither enough money to live on, nor minimal health, nor this little health of which I speak, and who have suffering, it is that's mommie's, but that's not old age, old age isn't bad at all, old age with enough money and enough health left, that's great, that's great why, I first of all believe, there is only old age left, first of all we arrived, it's not nothing, it's not a feeling of triumph, but in fact, it's that we've just arrived . We have arrived after all in a world that includes wars, saltés of virus, we will go through all that, viruses, wars, mess, we have just arrived. And it's a moment, it's no longer a question of one thing, it's being, being. There is no longer being this, being that is being. The old man is someone who is, it's a mess. We can always say, oh, that's beautiful, no, it's not a good death, it's very short, it has acquired the right to be very short, that's it. Because to an old man all the same, someone old, he can always say, I have plans, but it's true, it's not true, it's plans, not the way someone , 30 years, projects. I hope to do well there, these two books that she is authoring, on literature, on philosophy, I hope well, but without fail, I am free from any project, I am free from any project, I'm free to, we're more likely, you know when we're old. 14, ha! We have more, we have more susceptibility, we have more, we have more fundamental disappointment, when I mean, we have more, we are much more disinterested, we really like people for themselves. Me, I have the impression that it created a perception, for example, of things that I hadn't seen before, of elegances that I hadn't been sensitive to. There, I had it for better, because, I look at someone for himself, almost as if it were lying for me, in the rush, the as if I were, in the rush, a a percept to extract from him, a percept all that, all that makes old age, an angel, and the days think of an annulment, with their cancers, fatigue, fatigue, but it's not an illness, fatigue, it's something else, it's said death, it's still, it's once again the signal, the end of the day. So well, over years ago, me, with old age, but I'm done avoiding them to ward them off, it's easy to ward off, it's kind of like werewolves or not lying or like vampires , I really like that, as you shouldn't be alone, at night when it starts to happen, it's there, you're too slow to say to yourself, it's going to do so, there are things to avoid , it will be for you, but, and then the wonder is that people make you white, society makes you white, so that's let down by society, it's so hard, it's not just society, but he is much held in hook, but to someone who is not demongaged, or who is not retired, cannot imagine what the joy, to be let down by society. So obviously, when I hear old people, it's those who want to be near old people, it's those who would like their peace so old as that, they can't stand retirement, they don't know why, they have that by reading refunds, they discovered less, they discovered something, they can't stand, or else, I don't think, regret, at the retirement that blows away, it's Japanese cases, perhaps, I don't think, in retirement who, who, can't find themselves doing something, that's it, it's berneil, I mean, yes, we're letting you go, so we'll wash things over for you, or else, I'm a fig , you got stuck a little so that it falls, that all the parasites you've had on the dowry all your life, bah, and so much, and what's left around you, nothing but people that you love, people who remain with you and who support you and who also love you when needed, the rest tempts you, and again, when I speak, at that moment it becomes very hard when there is something nosaltres, that society, I no longer go along with it, that we talk, that we talk, the life of retirement, all the arms, it's the shoe. So I know that society, I am ignorant, I am completely ignorant, society. So, the catastrophe is when there is someone who believes that I am still part of it, whereas he simply is completely different, because what we do, in itself -even, it's so much part of a good old age dream, but who asked me for an interview, an entretiote, or that, I told him, but it's not going well, the head is not common, that I'm old and that society has let me down, but that's good, I think we take things to heart, it's not the old people that we need, we have to talk about... yes, he you have to talk about the biseire and the suffering, then that, when you're old, worse terrible and suffering, there, I know, there's no good port, that's for sure, but if not, then, an old pure, that he is nothing, a little old, that is being, yes. But yet, as you are sick, tired and old, it may be perfect, distinguishing the three things, it is sometimes difficult for your people around you, they are less old, less sick and less tired that you, your children, or your wife? But children, but children, there are not many problems, because there could be, if it was younger, but like, they are old enough to live on their own, and I do not breathe dependent, and so it's a reaction, when they say, really, he looks too tired, but anyway, I don't think there's a problem with the children, and with Fanny, I think that it's not a problem either, even if, it's, even maybe, I don't know, it's very difficult, only from someone, we love, what would he do , in what would he have done in another life? Alright, if we're not going to travel, as she might have wished, but what else have we discovered, that we wouldn't have discovered, it's had traveled , she always had, she also, always had very strong literary information, it allowed her, what did it allow her to discover in the planid remances, and it is well worth the trips, all that, well course, there are problems, as I would say, one exceeds. And finally, the projects, for example, when you approach your projects for the next book, the books on literature, it is last, what is philosophy? How funny is it to approach them old, these projects, when you said earlier, more or less, there are no more funny things there too. Ah, not because it's a wonderful thing, you know. First of all all the same, there is a whole evolution, and when you are old, you have a certain idea of what you want to do, which becomes more and more pure. I mean, which is getting more and more refined. I give the link to the famous lines of a Japanese designer, such pure lines, if there is nothing, there is nothing, a little line, all that. I can conceive that, I project myself from an old, something that is so pure, if there is nothing, and at the same time, that is everything, that is so marvelous, I mean, to arrive at a sobriety. It may come that you have. So what is philosophy? That, research, what is philosophy? First of all, I find it handled at a good margin. We are going to research, what is philosophy? To have the feeling that I know it, that I am it, the only one to know it, that I know it, therefore also, I will happen to die there under a nobody bus, do not appear to see, to do the philosophy, all that is extremely pleasant for me. But now I could have done a book on what is philosophy? 30 years ago. I know it would have been very, it would have been a very, very different book, very very different from what I am consuming now, or I would like to arrive at a kind of sobriety and such that... Yes, then, well I would succeed or not, but I know that it is now that I must consume, that before, I would not have known how to do it now, I tell myself that I am capable of doing it, but, in anyway, it will not look like a good point.
