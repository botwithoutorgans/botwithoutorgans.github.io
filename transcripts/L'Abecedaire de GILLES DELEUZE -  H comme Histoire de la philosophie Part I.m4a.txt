And welcome. So H is H... I'm a man, I'm framed. What did we do? What did we do? H is H as in the history of philosophy. We are used to saying that there is in your work a first stage devoted to the history of philosophy. From 1952 you are created a study on David Hum, please books on Nietzsche, Kant, Berksson and Spinoza. Those who hadn't read you and took you for a commentator were very surprised by the logic of meaning, difference and repetition, and of course, the antiedie, pépil plateau. As if there had been a hidden mystery that had meddled in Jekyll's doctor. And then everyone was explaining Marx, you immersed yourself in Nietzsche. And then where everyone had to link Reich, or read Reich, you turned to Spinoza with his famous question and you can still today in 1988, you come back to Nietzsche. What did you like and still like about the history of philosophy? You didn't make it complicated because... that also engages philosophy itself. I will say, I guess a lot of people think that philosophy is something very abstract and a bit for specialist. I so visually had the idea that philosophy, to have a specialist, is not a specialty, or the air, in the same sense as painting, than music, that inevitably the problem, I seek to oppose it otherwise. When we believe that philosophy is abstract, the history of philosophy is abstract to two degrees, a second degree since it even consists more in speaking about abstract ideas, it consists in forming abstract ideas on abstract ideas. And if you are another way, in fact for me, the history of philosophy, it has always been something else and here I come back to painting. I think discussions in Van Gogh's letters found discussions about portrait or landscape. I'm going to do the portrait, what the portrait, you have to come back to the portrait, they attach a lot of importance in their conversation, in their letter, portrait and landscape. It's not the same, it's not the same problems. For me, in the history of philosophy, like a kind of empature, it's a kind of portrait tree. We make the oportrer of a philosopher. But we make the philosophical portrait of a philosopher. I mislead a mediumistic portrait as well, that is to say a mental portrait, a spiritual portrait. So well, it is an activity that is fully part of philosophy, just as the portrait is part of painting. All of a sudden, the fact that I send painters pushes me a little bit. If I come back again to painters like Van Gogh, like Gauguin, there is one thing that touched me, enormously about them. It's the kind of enormous respect, even of fear, of panic, not only respect, but fear is panic in front of the color, having to approach the color. So, it's particularly pleasant that it's not being the two that I quote, to maintain to them, are among the greatest colorists there are. But if we go back to the story of their work, to approach color, but it's done with real tremor, they're afraid. And the whole beginning of their work is what we call potato colors, colors... Colors, earth colors, potato colors, not at all dazzling, why? Not if they have the taste, but because they would not have approached the color. And, even if there is something more thrilling than that, literally, they still consider themselves worthy, they still consider themselves capable of tackling color, that is to say of really painting. They give them years, years to dare to approach color. They have to think that they are capable of going into color. It gives what everyone knows. But when you see, that's what they arrive at, you also have to think about this immense respect, this immense slowness to approach it. Something of color for a being is all the same something that goes as far as madness, unreason. So, very difficult, you have to defuse before you dare touch something like that. So, it's not at all that I'm particularly modest, but I say to myself, it's still a little shocking, it would be shocking, if there were philosophies like that. I'm going to go into philosophy, I'm going to do my philosophy, yes, I have my philosophy, all that is words, marbles, doing your philosophy. Philosophy is like color. Before entering into philosophy, it is necessary to be so careful. Before conquering the philosophical color and the philosophical color is the concept. Before knowing where to get to invent concepts, but it takes such work. And me, I believe that the history of philosophy is this slow modesty, you have to paint portraits for a long time. You have to do a long time, you have to paint a portrait. And then, it's as if a novel was there telling us, “Ah, I write novels, but you know, in order not to compromise my inspiration, I never read them. Others, I don't know. I've heard novels got there young, hold its startling proposals. Which is to say, I don't need to work. But as in a corner that is easy, it takes a long time to work before you can approach something. I believe that the history of philosophy, which is not simply preparatory, goes perfectly by itself. And the tears of the portrait, as it will allow us. First, something, that I think, it becomes mysterious. You would have to specify, you would have to force me to specify. I don't know, that's another small question, or I can continue like this. What happens when we do the history of philosophy? No, you got something else left on that. No, but the usefulness of the history of philosophy, the usefulness for you, we can see it clearly, you have just explained it, the usefulness of the history of philosophy for people, in general, since you don't know, since you don't say you don't want to talk about the specialization of philosophy, philosophy is also addressed to non-philosophies. We can understand, it's very simple. We can understand what philosophy is, that is to say to what extent? It's not at all, abstract things, philosophy, it's not even more, he doesn't see more than a painting, an agro-musical, it's absolutely not abstract. And that, we can understand, only by talking about the history of philosophy. On condition of conceiving it, it seems to me, if I may say so, on condition of conceiving it properly. Because what is it? There is one thing that seems certain to me, and that is that a philosopher is not someone who contemplates and he is not even someone who thinks. A philosopher is someone who creates. Simply, he creates a kind of thing, quite special, he creates concepts. Concepts don't exist completely, they don't walk around in the sky, they're not stars, we don't contemplate them, they have to be created, they have to be made. So there would be 1000 questions already, or we are already lost, because there are so many questions that arise. What's the point of recreating concepts? Because it would be a concept, but we let it go, for the moment, we let it go. I say, how an example, if I created a book on Plato? People, they know well that Plato creates there a concept which did not exist before him, and which generally translated by the idea. The idea with a capital t, with an image, and what does Plato call the idea? It is not at all the same thing as what another philosopher calls an idea. It's really a Platonition concept to the point that if someone has come up with the idea, in a similar sense, it looks like, well yes, he's a Platonition philosopher. I say to myself concretely what is it? You should never ask yourself, a fact of philosophy, if you don't have to do it, you really have to ask yourself, but what is it like if you have a dog? What had an idea? A dog, I can define it, what is an idea? For Plato, on there, I already do a hundred philosophies. I'll try to explain, like, that's it, well, even the need for a teacher, it seems to me to say, it doesn't seem to me the idea, it's something that wouldn't be anything else, that is to say, it would only be what it is. So there too, it seems abstract, I was saying it earlier, you mustn't be abstract, you have to do something that it is, it's abstract. But no, no, no. Taking a case which is not, which is not in Plato. A mother, a mother, a mother. She's a mother, but she's not just a mother. I mean, she is, for example, a wife, and then herself a mother's daughter. It's not a mother who is only a mother. It doesn't matter if such a thing exists or not. For example, is life marie, which Plato did not know, is a mother who is only a mother. And it doesn't matter if it exists or not. A mother who would not be anything else like a mother, who would not in turn be the daughter of our mother, that is what must then be called the idea of a mother. A thing that is just what it is. That's more or less what she means, Plato, we said to ourselves, only justice is just. Because only justice is nothing but just. I say finally, it's very her. So it becomes very simple. An idea of course, that's pretty close, but its point of departure is supposed to be such entities which of themselves than what they are. We call them idea. So he fears real concept, this concept did not exist before. The idea of the thing as pure, it is the purity that was finished the idea. But it remains abstract, we appear, why? For what ? If we ignore it, we indulge in reading Plato, and that's where everything becomes so concrete. He goes there in Paraza, he doesn't even like this concept of idea. paraza. He finds himself in a given situation. It's that whatever happens, in a very concrete situation, whatever happens, or whatever is given, there are suitors. That is to say there are people who say for this thing, it is less the better. Exemploi, it gives a definition of politics. And he says the political is to put a first definition, a definition of proof of departure, it is the passer-tor of men. He is the one who takes care of men. But on top of that, lots of people arrive and say, well, in that case, politics is less. It is less the passer-tor of men. It's seeing the trade there, can say that, the shepherd, who feeds all the doctor who treats, can say, he is less the true smuggler of men. In other words, there are you shores. So it starts to get a little more concrete. I say, a philosopher creates concepts. For example, the idea. The thing as pure. The reader does not immediately understand why, what it is about, that she needs to create such a concept. But if he also continues, reflects on his reading, he realizes that it is for the following reason. It's because there are all sorts of rivals who pretend to the thing, they are pretenders. And that the Platonist problem, it's going to be not at all, that what the idea is, all that, it's going to be reduced to the abstract. It's how to select the suitors, how to find out which of the suitors is the right one. And it is the idea, that is to say the thing in the making that will allow this selection, which will select the one that comes closest to it. So that allows us to move forward a little because I would say, any concept, for example, the concept of an idea, refers to a problem. The problem in this case is how to select suitors. If we do abstract philosophy, we don't even see the problem. Yes, if we reach the problem, the problem, why isn't it said by the philosopher? He is there in his work, we find, he is there, he is, he is staring, there is a meaning to it. Not if we can't do it all at once. The philosopher, he has already exposed the concepts that he is in the process of creating. It cannot additionally expose the problems to which it is concept. Or at least, we can find these problems only through the concepts that it bursts. And if you haven't found the problem, that very beautiful concept, everything is abstract. If you have found the problem, everything becomes concrete. And that's why I have platoons, there is constantly, it's a pretender, who it's riveau. So, I can add to it all of a sudden, it becomes all that, it becomes that. It takes everything, of course. Why is it in the Greek city? Why is it plato? Who brings up this problem. You see, the problem is how to select the contenders and the concept, and that's the philosophy. This is the problem and the concept. The concept is the idea, which is supposed to remodel the means of selecting suitors, no matter how one has it would be. But... Why is this problem, this concept, this Greek medium format? It actually starts with the Greeks, it's a typically Greek problem. It is a problem of the city and of the democratic city, even if Plato accepts think of a democratic character of the city, it is a problem of the democratic city. It is in a democratic city, for example, that a magistracy is the object of claim, there are pretenders, I claim such a function, in an imperial formation, as there were in the Greek era. In an imperial formation, there are air functions which are named by the grand emprôtre. There is no such rivalry at all, the Athenian city, it is a rivalry of suitors. It's even already with the island, the suitors, in Pénaiglope, all that. Well, there is a whole middle, Greek problem. It is a civilization. The clash of rivals, constantly appears, that's why they before gymnastics. I mean, they before the one peak games. They advance, they are procedural, no one prose lasts like a Greek, but the procedure is the same thing, the trials. They are pretenders. You understand ? Philosophy, there will also be suitors. The struggle of Platos against the Sophists. This is where the house and the sophists are pretenders, something they are not entitled to. What will define the right or the non-right of a suitor? That's a problem. It's as fun as a novel. We know great novels, indeed, there are suitors who face each other in court. This is another thing. But in philosophy, I say, there are both at the same time. The creation of a concept and the creation of a concept is always done according to a problem. If we haven't found the problem, we don't understand the philosophy and she remained strept. I take a donation, for example, people generally don't see what a problem. It answers. They don't go to problems. Because the problems are, they are a little hidden, a little said, a little hidden, and the fact of the history of a philosophy is to restore these problems and suddenly, to discover a new summer of concepts. It says that the mavèse history of a philosophy, it threads the concepts as if. It helps him to be as if they were not created and there is total ignorance, organ problems. I'll take one last quick example for... For a thought of the next stores.
