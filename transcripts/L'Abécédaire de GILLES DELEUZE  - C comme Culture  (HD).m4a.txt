We're going to spend enough, so it's vast. It's expensive. It's like culture. Yes, I don't think so. So there you are, it's someone who tells you you're not cultured. That is to say that you say that you read, you only see films or you watch things for precise knowledge, the one you need for a precise defined work, which is the one you are doing. But at the same time, he is a person who, every Saturday at an exhibition, will have a film from the great cultural domain. One has the impression that there is a practice, a kind of effort in the culture, that you systematize and that you have a cultural practice. That is to say that you go out, you make an effort, you tend to cultivate yourself. And yet, I remind you, you say that you are not cultured at all. So how do you explain this little paradox? Isn't it cultured? No, to what I mean, when I mean the effect, when I say to you, when I don't invite myself as an intellectual at all and I don't see myself as someone cultured for a simple reason , it's that when I see someone cultured, I'm scared. I'm not so admiring, I'm admiring and in some ways, not at all, but I'm scared someone cultured. It is noticeable when even someone cultured. It is to know, but above all to know effarence. Someone who is cultured, we see that, in a strong mood, a lot, among intellectuals, he collapses everything, he collapses everything, it's not. They are common to everything. It's called the history of Italy at the arbeissance, it's called the geography of the North Pole, it opened up the whole list of it, it collapses everything, it can talk about everything, it's a baby there, when I say that I am cultured, of an intellectual, I mean a very easy thing, it is that I have no reserve knowledge, no knowledge at least, there I had no problem when I die, not to look for what I have published. Nothing, nothing, nothing, I have no reserve, I have no provision, I have no provisional knowledge, and everything I learn, I learn for such a task. And there task done, I forget it so well that if 10 years later, I am forced, then we give each other a lot of joint, if I am forced to a better master in something similar or in the same subject , I have to start over from 0, except for a few rare fours because it's pidosa and in my heart, so yes I don't forget you, it's my heart, it's not my head. But if, then for I don't admire, it's republishing, it's republishing, it's republishing, it's an opinion on all subjects. No, it's not republishing, they know how to travel first through Les Isons, they have traveled through history, through geography, they know they can talk about anything. I heard at the athelix, it's Faros who hears degon, so as I'm full of admiration, I can even say, people like echo, or me echo, it's prodigious. Me, for him ten, well that's it, it's as if my thing is supported enough, and he knows it moreover, it's not at all. So I can't say that I'm aiming for it, I'm spared, but I'm not aiming for it at all. It's a certain way, I tell myself the culture, it's good, it's because we keep me busy talking. Above all, I can't help it, well, as long as I do more lessons than I do their milking, for example, I tell myself more and more, not to leave, it's a little dirty, it's a little dirty , writing is clean, writing is clean, but speaking is that. That's it, because it's charm, it's charm, well I never knew how to wear the school-locke, since I was in school-locke when I was very young, never been able to wear the school-locke. I don't travel, why don't I travel, because intellectuals, me, I travel very well, if, well, I really travel, well, that doesn't bother you, but intellectuals travel, it's rice food What. They don't travel, they move to talk. So they talk to their right where they talk, to go to the other place they go talk. And then even on their knees, they will talk with the intellectuals of the place, they won't stop talking. I am for this not speaking, I am for this not. So as before my life, it seems that it has culture, it is very much linked to speech. In this sense, then I have the culture, I can not stand it. But that, we will come back to separation, clean creatures and dirty speech, because we were a very great teacher, and separation. But that, we'll come back to that, we'll come back to that since it's the being, that there's a professor at your work. And that, we will have the opportunity to talk about seduction again. I have the dare, bobbine, five. A second. Just go. So I would still like to come back to this thing that you have somewhat eluded, this discipline that you impose on yourself, even if you don't need it, in fact, to see I don't know, let's admit in the last 15 days the exhibition of polques remusées of modern weapons, you go all the same often enough not to say of weapons, of weapons even a large film or even an exposure of painting. So, you're not he reddit, you're not that he's going there, you have no admiration for the people that he's going to you there, as you just said. So, what does this practice, this reform, correspond to? Is it fun? I think not. Yes, of course, it's fun. Finally, it is always fun. But then I think of the stissement of being at the agaires. I don't believe in certain band culture and what I believe in is meeting people. And meetings don't happen with people. People, they always believe that it's people who meet each other, so it's terrible, there it's part of the culture, the intellectuals who meet this conlock jump, all that saie, this woman, but meetings don't happen with people, they happen with things. There are ages encounters on the blackboard, yes, you encounter, moreover, music, I encounter music, yes, I understand that means the right to encounter. When people evolve people in camp, the more I am the right to meet with themselves, with people, there it goes more at all. It's not encounters, that's why encounters are so, so seubindres, it's always disasters, encounters with people. But me, as you say, when I go on Saturday, he says, I'm not sure I'll meet him, but I'm leaving, I'm happy for, isn't there a saddlebag at the same time, a painting, a film, so it's great, I take the example, not except for me. Camps made something, it is a question of getting out of it, it is a question of both staying there and getting out of it. So staying in philosophy is also how to get out of philosophy. But getting out of a philosophy doesn't mean doing anything else, that's why you have to get out while staying, it's not doing anything else, it's not making a robot, first of all I don't will be incapable, but even I will be capable, I believe that would mean absolutely nothing to me. Me, I want to get out of philosophy through philosophy, that's what interests me, that's it. That's to say. I take the example, like all that, it's after my death, I can be without my esti. I've just done a book on a great philosopher called Laineyt, and insisting on a notion, well, that I didn't bring back home, but which is very important to me, which is the fold, the notion of fold. I consider myself to have written a book of philosophies. Well, on this somewhat bizarre notion of a fold. What's happening to me on this? I receive letters as always bays, bank letters. There are incidifying letters, even if they are hearty and warm and touch me a lot, they are letters that say to me, good, you have done very well, they are letters from intellectuals who have hebeo , not the mayor, this book. And then I receive from letters or to the letter, 200 letters, which strike my eyes. There are letters from people telling me, but your fold story is us. It's us. And I realize that these are people who are part of an association, which groups 400% in French. You see the least, maybe they will increase. It is the association of paper folding. They had to review, they had to review, well here it is, reviewed and say, but we are in complete agreement. What you do is also what we do with water. Well, I say to myself, this, this, I have neighborhood. Thereupon, I receive other kinds of letters. And they speak exactly the adventement to go there. They say the fold is water. But it is such a wonder. First, it reminds me of Platos. It's in Platos, the philosophers, for me, it's not at all abstract people, the great low struts, great heights very, very concrete. I have platoons, there is a story that will bring joy, it is that one, and which is undoubtedly linked to the beginning of philosophy, it will thank you will come back, because on that, the head of Platos is he gives a definition. For example, what is politics? Politics is the pastor of men. And on top of that, there are a lot of people who arrive saying, well, you see, politics is water. For example, the bath is obliged to arrive saying, well, I dress men. I am therefore the true shepherd of men. The butcher arrives, tell me I feed the men. I am the pastor of men. The rivals, to the hero, I had this experience a little. Here, the folds, we are not going to trap, which arrive by saying, the fold is water. The others I'm talking about, there, who will see exactly the ventil of being, it's not so much, it's the sorfers. Learn well seen in the case report with the folds of paper. The sorfeurs, they say, we are completely in agreement, us, because what do we do? We know this step of that, if duait in the folds of nature. For us, nature is, it's a set of bop folds, so we stay in the fold of the wave. To live in the fold of the wave, that's what, it's a task for us. To live in the fold of the wave, and indeed, they spoke to the bire à pleuban, it is already completely. They think, they don't just think, they think what they do. We talk to them about it, also maybe, with if we talk to them, in sport, day by day, the world will talk about it. But that, we started from the meeting, these are meetings. So that's dating. When I say, get out of philosophy, through philosophy, that's a great advice to me all the time, because it's encounters, I've encountered the folds of paper, I don't know need to see them , we would be disappointed, no doubt, I would be disappointed, and I would be even more disappointed, no need to see them, but I met them with surfing, with the folds of paper, so there you have come out of philosophy , by philosophy, that is an encounter. So I think that the encounters, when I go to see the exhibition, it was really, what am I, looking for a painting that touches me, a painting that moves me. When I also want to eat them, not at the theater, because the theater is too long, it's too much of an idea, it's too much, it's too exhausting, it doesn't seem artelle, except in certain cases , except Bob Wilson and Carmelo Bédé, I don't have the feeling that the theater is very, very caught up in our time, but except it's an extreme, but stay four hours to six, on a moment armchair, I can't anymore no matter what health reasons, so it's the theater, that for me. But yes, it has a patio exhibition too, the stockings, but I always have the impression that the bioseur risks meeting him, idea. Yes, but there is none, finally the film by distraction, it is not culture, that. It's not culture, but there is no distraction, that is to say that... My distraction, everything is part of a job. It's shit, no, it's not work. I mean, it's agais, I mean, we've been watching for something happening and saying to me, do you think it finds me, it's going well, it's very funny. It's not dimarfi who's going to trouble, it's not... Dimarfi, he's an American comedian in the latest films, they are real public successes, you'll never see, no, you only watch Benille on television. Yes, Ben Bédille, I'm interested, we have a risk, I'm interested, it gives, that it's not... I'm not saying, it's certainly not very good things, Dermel, that is no reason to interest me. But when you go out, it's for a meeting. When I go out, if there is no idea to antiré, if I don't say to myself, well, he had an idea, what are the great ideas, to sow, that also applies to the filmmakers, what will do me in beauty, for example, I take a great comedal, or like the other, but what touches me in that also in... They are pursued by unified units. Ah but that, which drags the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, there is a rat of all that. Well, we'll stop there, but that's what seems to me to be a meeting. We make encounters with things, it goes without saying with people. It's dating. At the moment, because there are a lot of meetings to talk about a specific cultural period, which was one of... Oh yes, yes, I just said it, the puckers and the surfers, who do you want, more beautiful. That's not meetings with intellectuals, you see, I don't do meetings with intellectuals. Or if I meet an intellectual, it's for other reasons that I love him, and that I want to meet him, it's for what makes his current job, his charm, all that. We make encounters with his elebans, with the charm of the people, with the work of the people, but not with the people, who are almost crazy. There is nothing at all. So the more he can rub like cats? Yes, there is a pool, so that, if, in which, brushing, it was not really horrible. It's you, you have a often, it's good, I say you're a real one. It's good, here it is. Go ahead. So we go back to the rich periods and the poor periods of culture. Yes. And right now, you think it's a not so rich period. Finally, I see you very often, you acted in front of the television, in front of the literary emissions, that we are not mistaken there, although in the moment when that will be diffused, the names will be different. Are you sure that it is a rich period or a particularly poor period, the one we are living through? Bah, he must be poor. It's poor, but at the same time, it's not at all. It's not at all for growth, yes, it deserves because at... Yes, I said to myself, I say it at my age, I say to myself, it's not the first time that there are poor times. I tell myself, what have I been through since I reached the age of Montousiasme and a little... I experienced liberation, that repaid me for liberation. It was the richest period of the period imaginable. We rediscovered everything. The liberation, there had been the war, it was not nothing, it was not a pie. We rediscovered all the rebound in America Kafka. Weeks require discovery, there was Sartre, you can't imagine what was there. I mean intellectually what we discovered, where we rediscovered while beaten, etc. It's here. You have to understand things like the great controversy, should Kafka be burned. It was imaginable and it seems a little late today, but it was really a creative atmosphere, it was a very, very strong atmosphere. I knew before 68 which was an extremely rich period until shortly after 68. When there are periods for your periods, it is very normal. It is not the fact of poverty which is embarrassed, it is the solemnity or the power of those who have poor times. They're much meaner than people in geniuses who fatten up in rich times. They are brilliant at the right ensemble, because we have the day when I saw precisely, we are talking about the Kafka controversy at the liberation. I saw at the exendre thing which was very very happy to say that he had never read Kafka and he said it completely while laughing. They are very happy, the more they are stupid, the more they are happy. It is those who consider that arancion comes down to its tail, literature is a small private matter. If we consider that, we don't need the Erik Kafka there, we don't need much of the Erik there, since if we have a Brown Thursday anymore, we are by nature Kafka's legal. Since it's not work, they don't do work. I mean how to explain, to take things more serious than I jump. I went to see it not long ago, like it's a movie. No, it doesn't have the genre, it was admirable. There is a very moving film in a Russian who made his film 30 years ago, and then he just passed. The Covid-Saint. There, I grabbed something that I didn't see, and that wouldn't be moving. It's that this film was very very good, very good, we can't do it well. Perfect. But we said to ourselves with Théror or with a kind of compassion, that it was a film like the Russians were making before. From the time of Aisaine Chythane. In the time of Aisaine Chythane, of Dove Shadecourt, that's fine with you. Everything there you are. Parallel editing, including parallel editing, sublime, etc. It's as if nothing had happened since the war, as if nothing had happened in the cinema. And I was saying, it's forced. The film is good, that's it, but it was very strange. The very beautiful because of that, if he wasn't very good, it was because of that. And literally, someone who had been so alone in his work, that he was filming as we were filming, there was a time rather, it's not that you're down on it. But precisely, it suits you very well, he was prodigious, there was a time. Everything that had happened since, he hadn't known. I tell you, he grew up in a desert. Very poured a desert, it's not much. Very versed a desert, it's not great, very versed a desert period. What is terrible is to be in it. It's growing up in a desert. That's awful. I guess, one must have a feeling of loneliness. For people who are 18 now, for example. Yes, especially when you understand that when things, that's what emmeters in periods. When things disappear, nobody without the person. For one simple reason, it's that when something disappears, it doesn't shade. The Stalinist period made Russian literature disappear. But the Russians will not have perceived. I mean, the bulk of the Russians. All the Russians did not perceive. A literature that was literature for the slope, in all the saying, there are indeed 10 by one. I hear well, well, we are told now, there are dissidents, etc. We are there at the level of the people, a Russian people, it was not raturatism. It takes a turatism, yes. And no one without knowing them. Today, I think I will report on what is happening today. But nevermind, there are obviously new young people who are genius banks. I think, guess, it's a bambaisse expresseur, but guess the new bacquests. Today's new bacquests, I have the sense. I have the sense, there are the new philosophers. Oh, yes, I don't have to not like it. But the new bacquests today. S'suppose not publish them yet. After all, bacquête has failed well by the published ones. It is obvious that there is demented fear. By definition a big turn of Rua Gébi, which brings something new. If this new one doesn't appear, I don't have anyone without a bank, anyone, since we had no idea. If for where it hadn't... If Kafka hadn't been published, we can't say that Kafka hasn't anchored. If the other had burned all of Kafka, no one must say, ah, like that, from the lack, since we would have no idea what disappeared there. If the new bacquests today are had, or are prevented from being published by the current publishing system, we won't be able to say, ah, like that, no, no, if we did... I heard a statement. So, the statement, I heard, I believe in my daughter, the most important there is, I don't want to say who we preceded it in a newspaper, especially since what I'm sure of it is something thing of the edition, which has to the adhirs, you know, today, we are more likely to make errors like Gali-Mar, time more and more prousts, because with the means which we have, I make you. Dear head shorts, dear head shorts. We dream, we dream, the means we have today to find the new proustes and the new bacquests, in other words that we would have a counter that is perfectly unimaginable, since we don't know what didn't kill us new ones, and one dreams a meaning if one... Did it go over that head? Yes, yes, we passed it, we have that. So what defines the crisis today? It's all those tricky codes, that's it. The crisis today, I see it linked to three things, but it is hard to pass, I am very, very optimistic, that's what defines a period of losses. It is first that journalists, in case they have form a book. Journalists are always writing, I find it very good that journalists are writing. But not in a long time, when the journalists are put to make a book, they felt that they passed to another form, that is to say that it was not the same thing as to write their article of day-your. We can even consider that for a long time, it was the writers who were journalists, badly armed, they could do journalism. But the reverse did not produce. Here, it's the opposite. The journalist, as journalists, is a book, that is to say that they find it very normal to make a book like that, which is hardly a leg artier. That's not good there. The second reason is that it generalizes the idea that everyone could write, because writing was everyone's business. So, with the family archives, either arche, writings, or archive. either archive in the head. Everyone had the love story, everyone had, like a sick grandmother once, a mother who died in terrible conditions, we say to ourselves, that's a meal. It's just that it doesn't make a meal at all. But really not at all. So... And then... The third reason is that... You know, real customers have changed. And that we hardly notice it, except people, except of course. You are aware, but... The customers have changed, I mean, the television customers, that's who... It's not the listeners anymore, the television customers, it's the ads. They are the real customers. The listeners, they have... They have what they want, the announcements... The spectators. Spectators, yes. Gilles de l'ose, seventh bobbine. Wait a minute, that's not the plan. Before... Just a moment, that's true. And then the third reason, what is it? Well, says to himself, yes, the ads are the real customers. There is more... And so, I was saying, in publishing, well... And there is a risk, which is that the real customers of publishers are for potential readers. It's the distributors. When distributors are truly publishers' customers, what will happen? What interests distributors is the rapid rotation. Fast turnover means big market stuff. Quick rotation, best salary scheme, etc. That is to say, the whole idea makes up for it. If I tell you with the stick, all the creative rature idea, will be crushed by nature. But does that already exist for you? We preform what are the needs? Yes, that's what's going on. That's what's slipping away. The drought period, that's a pivot bowl. It's indulgence, it's literature, it's indulgence. The provision any literary criticism, commercial promotion is given. But when I say this engagement, it's obvious that... Where will there be parallel circuits? At circuits, there will be everything on the black market, there will be this land. It is not possible for a people to live in Russia. She lost her literature. She is racy. She will conquer it. She recounts all that, puts it away. The rich periods are our periods for... So, it's... Unhappy poor. On this idea of walking parallel or of the black market, the subjects have been performed for quite a long time. That is to say that one year, for example, we see very clearly that in the books that come out, it's war, another year, it's the death of parents, another year, it's is attachment to nature. In fact, that's how it is. For nothing, an alert to form. And the begins to resurface. You have already seen a pot period reappear, rich with a pot period. Did you attend? Yes. Once again. After the liberation, it is not strong. And then there were 68. Between the great creative period and the liberation. And the start of the new wave sequence is 60. 70. The 9th. Between 72 and 72. But so much there was a new, rich period. Yes. He uses it very well. It's a bit if you want, that's what Unit says, I'm fine. Someone throws an arrow. He shoots an arrow out there in space. That's it, or even a period, a collectivity, throws an arrow and then it falls. And then someone comes to the mom, it's sending. It's how it works like that, creation, literature. It passes on desires.
