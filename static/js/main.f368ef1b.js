haven't thought about the theme a little anymore. It is an answer to a question without having thought a little, it is for me something of a comsimable to what. When he saves us, that's the clause. The clause is all that to be reused, if it is usable, to be reused only after my death. So you understand, I already feel reduced to the state of a pure archive of Pierre Andr\xe9 Boutan, sheets of paper and it brings me back a lot, it consumes a lot of it, and almost to a state of pure spirit, I'm talking after my death and we know that he's done with having turned the state of pure mind, he's not someone who gives very deep, very intelligent answers, it's a bit simple. So everything goes, everything goes in there, we start, it's to help what you want. Alright, let's start with a. So it's animal. So, animal, we can take WCfield's sentence for you, a man who has neither children nor animals cannot be completely bad. So, we're going to leave the children aside for the moment, but the pets know that you don't like them very much, well, we don't know, but I know that you don't like them very much, and there you don't even take the distinction de laur de C\xf4que-Taux, dear ones are no better than dogs for you. On the other hand, you have a beast through your work which is rather repulsive, that is to say, in addition to fakes, which are noble animals, you talk a lot about the type of louse, a certain number of small animals like that repugnant. And what I would like to add is that the animals in addition, you have been used a lot since the Antille of Ipe, a concept which has become principal in your work, which is becoming animal. So, I would like to know a bit clearly what your relationship is with animals. The animals are not, yes. What you said is there if it goes to me in relation to domestic animals, it's not a domestic animal, an animal to be expected wild, that's not what worries me. The songs, the dogs, the problem is my pets and familios. And it's true that pets or familios that are intended to be domesticated, I don't fight. On the other hand, domesticated, unfamiliar, unfamiliar animals, I don't like because I'm sensitive to something in those. So, what didn't happen is for me, what happens in many families, I was without a candle who has, and then our children, in my family, bring in these little hands, a shock was no greater than aptness. They had found him somewhere in the countryside, they had found him in a payet, in this country, I don't know what. And from that fateful moment, I always had a cat at home. So, what displeased me? Finally, it's not going to be a nightmare, I'm worn. What displeased me? I don't like scrubbers already. A passing cat rubbing against you. I do not like that. A cat is something else, so what I basically blame chins for is barking. The limp will really speak, but the most stupid cry, God who described in nature, there is a barrie was written, the limp, it is really the circle of the animal kingdom. I support in range, I support better, provided it is not too long, the cry I do not know how to say, the howling at the moon. Dog howling at the moon, I bear better than death. I don't know what, I can tolerate brumard better than there. And then since I recently learned that dogs and cats rub social security, my antipathy has increased even more. What I'm going to say is that it's very important, at the same time what I'm saying is completely silly because people who really like cats and dogs obviously have something to do with dogs. and cats that aren't human. They have with dogs and cats, for example children, we can clearly see that children have with a cat, a relationship which is not a human relationship with the cat, which is a kind of relationship either frontin, or which is a species. The importance is to have an animal relationship with the animal. So why does the animal relationship with the animal consist of talking to him, in any case what I can't stand is the human relationship with the animal. I know what I'm saying because I say a street there, which is a bit deserted and where people walk their dogs. What I hear my window is properly and beacon, and beacon, the way people can steal it from them. So even the apsicanalysre marks, the apsicanalysre is so attached to pets, to local families, to family animals, that everything is animal in a dream. For example in dreams, is interpreted by apsicanalysis as an image of peace, mayor or children. That is, the animal as a member of the family. It's to the gods, I can't stand it. You have to think of two ch\xe8des of a great from Doignais Rousseau, the dog in the cart which is really the big pair, the big worst at the tapure, and then the war horse, the war horse, which is a real beast. The question is that it relates to living with the animal. If you have a human relationship with the animal, but generally when people who love animals don't have a human relationship with the animal, they have an animal relationship with the animal, and that's very good . Even hunters, even for you, I don't hunters, even hunters have an amazing relationship with animals. So I think there's a band and in addition, the other animals, it's true that I'm fascinated by meters like stoppers, ticks, ends, or that, it's as important as chains singing them, and it's animal relations too, someone who has ticks, who has ends, what that means is animal relations that are very active. So what fascinates me in the animal because really, I was helped by certain animals and fed by my fascination for many animals. What, here, will I make it count to tell me what strikes me in the animal? The first thing that strikes me, I think, is the fact that every animal has a world. It's that, yes, there are levels of people, there are levels of humans who don't have a gang. He lives the life of everyone, that is to say of a portu which is of a portu what, the animals, they have orders. What is an animal world? It is sometimes extraordinarily restricted. And that's what pleases me. The animals, they ultimately react to very few things. There are all sorts of things which, if you see that... I'm working on it, Bobin II, wait a second. When you want ? Yes, in this story, this first trait of the animal is really the existence of... of worlds with particular specific immos. And maybe... It's sometimes the poor head, it's my, the reduction, the reduced character, it's my, of one that interests me a lot. For example, we were talking earlier about a property like ICT. ICT responds to reacts to three things. Three exciting, one point that's all in a nature that is an immense nature. Three exciting, one point that's all. That is to say, she holds you towards the end of a tree branch, drawn towards the light. She can wait at the end at the top of this branch. She can wait for years without eating, without anything, completes her... Amorfe. She waits for a ruminant, a herbivore, an animal, not under her branch. Then, to blur it, there, it's a kind of olfactory excitement. She gets tired of it without the beast that passes under her branch. That's exciting second. The humian is then host. And then, when she has fallen on our palm, she goes to look for the area with the least hair. So, there, an active stimulant. It sinks under the skin. The rest she leaves. If we can say, she doesn't give a damn. In a providing nature, she extracts the selection of three things. This is your dream of life. That's what interests you in animals. That's what makes a world. That's what makes a world. Whence your animal relation to writing, that is to say that writing in vein for you is also someone who has a world. It's more complicated. He can refuse it not because there are other aspects. It is not enough to have a world to be an animal. What is easily completely is the business of territory. And with Ph\xe9lix, we really created a concept of...almost a philosophical concept with the idea of territory. Animals with territory, there are animals without territory. Territory animals are prodigious. Because constituted in territory, for me, it is almost the anessence of art. When we see how an animal marks its territory, everyone knows, everyone will always have the stories of gland in nalle, of the ryne, of... the wedges, it marks the borders of its territory. But it goes way beyond that. What intervenes in the marking of territory is also a series of postures. For example, this lowered stand up. A series of colors. The drys, for example, the colors of the buttocks of the drys, which they manifest at the border of the territory. What colors sing postures. These are the three determinations of art. I mean, the color, the lines, the animal postures are sometimes real lines. Colors, lines, songs. It's pure ralette. And then, when they leave their territory, or when they return to their territory, their behavior, the territory, is the domain of the path. It's very curious that it's in the way. That is to say my properties. My properties as the winnower of biquettes, biquettes or the winnower of michaux. The intervitory is the properties of the animal. And get out of the territory, that's it, go get it. There are beasts that recognize their spouses. They recognize in the territory, but they don't recognize out of the territory. All that, those wonders, I don't know what or not. It's the voice, I don't know. You have to believe me. And then, so with Phoenix, I leave the blow of the animal, I can follow a philosophical problem because one mixes a little all in the lowering of air. I say to myself, we sometimes approach philosophers to create my barbarians. But to me, put yourself in my place. For given reasons, I want to think about this notion of territory. And I say to myself, the territory is worth me in relation to a movement in which we leave it. So we have to put that together. I need a word that we appear barbaric. From then on, with Phoenix, we built a concept that I like very much, which is that of territorialisations. We are told on this, it is a hard word to say. Then, that means the need for that. There, it's a very Caouin word, a philosophical concept, perhaps disguised only by a word that doesn't yet exist. Even if we later discover that in other languages there was the equivalent. For example, then I realized that in Mellville, I kept coming across the word \u201cAoutlandish\u201d. And \u201cAoutlandish\u201d, finally, I was taking at the moment, you correct it yourself, \u201cAoutlandish\u201d, it is exactly the deterritorialized. It's a word of your word. So, I say for philosophy before coming back to the indibots, for philosophy, it's very striking. It is very striking. We sometimes need to come up with a word like barbarian. To account for a notion after new tension, the notion after new tension is that there is no territory, without a vector of exit from the territory, there is no exit from the territory, that is to say of deterritorialization, it goes at the same time to the effort for those to withdraw the elsewheres, those of something else. So all that plays into animals, that's what fascinates me. What fascinates me on the whole is the whole domain of signs. Animals emit signs. They do not know to resign signs. They produce signs, that is, to double-send and react to signs. For example, an arrenier, anything that touches its web. He doesn't react to just anything, he reacts to signs and he has signs, he produces signs. For example, the famous signs, is it a water sign, is it something else? I won't really go for people who know how to recognize, for example hunters, real hunters, hunters from hunting companies, but real hunters who know how to recognize the animal that has been there. At this time, animals are animals. At this time, animals are animals. That's it, an animal relationship with the animal. It's there, well, it's there. But it is this emission of signs, this reception of signs which approaches writing and writing and writing and writing. If I'm really going to say to myself, what is it for you that being an animal, you won't have anything real? It is being to the agents. It is basically a being for agents. Like writing? And the writing, well, the writing, yes, all the agents. The philosopher, all agents. The almond is with the agents. For me, the animal, you see, you see the animal ears, but it does nothing without being with the agents. We never quieted her down. It has never been quiet animal. He eats, he has to watch if he comes in the back, if something happens in the back, he will come next, etc. It's terrible, it's existing on his war. So you make the connection with the writing and that it will rot between the animal. He had me. It's true. I am brother. It would almost be necessary to say at the limit of inwriting, what is it? Of course, he writes for indescriptive voters. But what does that mean for? It means for... A writer, he writes for the reader. In a sense, he writes for voters. It must also be said that the writer writes for non-readers, that is to say not for the intention of one, but instead. For that means two things. It means in intention and then it means instead. So Arthur writes pockets that everyone knows. I write for the Adan Fabette. I write for idioms. It must have been written for the idioms. It means so that the idioms have it... It means so that the Adan Fabettes have it instead. I mean that I write instead of savages. I write instead of animals. And what does that mean? Why our russures like that? I write instead of Adan Fabette, idioms, beasts. Well because that's what we do instead when we write. When you write, you're not conducting a little private business. It's really the assholes. It's really the coiling, the literary mediocrity of all times, but particularly, that makes people believe to write a novel, for example, all you need is a little private affair, a little affair of one's own. He's a great mayor who died of cancer, his own love story, and then, he's going to write a novel. But it's a shame, it's a shame, it's things like that. It's not making it private to someone in writing. It's really getting into a universal business. And whether the novel or the philosophy, then what does that mean? Childish, third babbling. Wait a second. THANKS. So, it was written for, that is to say, for the intention and instead of, it's a bit like what you said in Mille Plateau, about Chand\xf4, it's off-manchital , in the very beautiful sentence, that the writer is inspired because he lives the animal as the only population to which he is responsible. That's it, that's absolutely it. And for a reason, that, I believe, is all that, it's not this whole product, literary declarations, it's the daily life of Irde-Eufmanstarr. This is another thing. It's because writing is necessarily pushing language and pushing the holy axis because language is pushing the holy axis to a certain limit. A limit who, what, bah, which can be expressed in several ways, it is just as much the limit which separates language from silence, as the limit which separates language from music, as the limit which separates language from something that would be what. Bah, let's say, if I say, the purely, the purely painful. But not the limp, especially. We see a name right away, not the limp, and again, who knows, you could have a writer arrive, the purely painful, all we say to ourselves, well yes, my Kafka, it's the metamorphosis, the manager who writes, you have heard, it sounds like an animal. Then high the painful world of Gregor, or the people of mice, we write for the people of mice, for the people of rachimeurs. Because contrary to what they say, it's not men who fall in love, it's animals and men when they die like animals. There, then we come back to the cat and with great respect, I had among the many cats who succeeded here. There is a little cat who died quite quickly, that is to say, I saw what many people saw too, how an animal looks for what to die. If there is a territory for death too, there is a search for the hospital of death, for the territory where one can die. There is this bottomless and in a known language, in an ancle, it was raco, as if it was the right place for him to die. Yes, in meaning, if writing is indeed survival, which pushes language to the limit, the limit which separates language from animality, which separates language from the cry, which separates language from the field. In that moment, you have to say yes, the writing is responsible in front of the laughing animals. He is responsible for having animals that laugh, that is to say, to answer for animals that laugh. Write good, literally not rotten, that I'm not going to write to eat, to eat, but to write laughing animals, etc. It is to carry language to this limit. There is no literature that carries through language and the holy axis, to this limit that separates language from animality. You have to be sure, it even limits. Me, I think. Even when we do philosophy, that's it. When we do, we are on the limit that separates thought from the anomalous. You must always be at the limit that separates you from animality, but precisely in such a way begins, more separated. There is an inherent inhumanity to the human body and the human mind. There are relationships to be said for with the animal. Well, if we were done can, that would be good.\",\"topics\":[\"animality\",\"becoming-animal\",\"ethics\",\"difference\",\"becoming\",\"body\",\"concept\",\"territory\"],\"length\":17887,\"wordCount\":3193},{\"letter\":\"B\",\"title\":\"Boisson\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE - B comme Boisson  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Boisson.mp3\",\"content\":\"So B, it's a bit special, it's about the drink. So you drank and then stopped drinking. And I would like to know when you drink-and, what was it? Drink. It was fun, what was it? Ah yes, I drank that a lot. I drank a lot. I quit so I drank a lot. That what it was is not difficult. I believe, I would like a therogy of other people when we drink a lot, a therogy of alcoholics, etc. I believe that to drink it is to do it in quantity. For that, there's no equivalent to food, even there are big eaters, there are people I eat, it's always going to taste bad, so we're not going to do it. But the drink is a question. I understand that we don't drink anything, that each drinker has a favorite saboisson. But it is because it is in this framework that grasps the quantity. It is to do with quantity, what does that mean? People make fun of drugs and alcoholics a lot, because they don't happen, you will say, know, me, I ob\xe9trise, I stop drinking when I want. We both laugh, but it's because we don't understand what they want. I have very clear memories, I saw that very well, I believe that all people who drink know that. When you drink, what you want to get to is the last green. Drinking is literally, it's doing everything to accept the last green. That's what interests you. Is it on the limit? Is that the limit, it's complicated. That's what tells you. In other words, an alcoholic is someone who hasn't stopped drinking. It is not to put in the last green. So what does that mean? It's a bit like Pegu's formula, which is so beautiful, it's not the last infidel who repeats the first. It is the first infeat who repeats all the others and the last. The first green, it repeats the last. It's the last that counts. So what does that mean? The last green for an alcoholic. He gets up in the morning, let's say he's a morning alcoholic. There's all the people you want, if it's a morning alcoholic. He's all tense about when he gets to the last green. It is not the first, what is the third that interests him. It's much more, it's banan, it's cunning, an alcoholic. The last green means this, it is valued, there is an evaluation. It is worth what can hold. Without it is crumbling, without it is worth. It is very worth, according to each person. It is therefore worth the last green. And then all the others, it will be his way of passing, of waiting for the latter. And the last one, what does it mean? Meaning, he can't bear to see any more that day. It's the last one that would allow him, that will allow him to begin the endemic again. Because if, if he just goes to the last, and on the contrary, it is the last, in his power. If passes the last in his power, to arrive at the last who is with this his power, he collapses. At that point, he's screwed. Well, he goes to the hospital, or else he has to change his habit, he has to change agency. So when he says the last green, it's not the last, it's the van derdie. He is the archer of the van derdie. When in other words, there is a good green, he doesn't get the last green, he looks for the peultimate green. Not the ultimate. Not the ultimate, not on the ultimate. Master him out of his advantage. And the ultimate is the last before their beginning of the yield. So I can say in the alcoholic, that's what says and who doesn't say it. Come on, that's what we hear in the Ecunfus. She dismisses alcoholic companies, in cafes. We can't stop listening to them. He is the one who always says. Come on, this is the last one. And the last, it will go according to each. And the last is the van derdie. And he's the one who also says, I'm quitting tomorrow. I stop tomorrow? No, he says not, I stop tomorrow. He says I quit today so I can start again tomorrow. And there, since drinking doesn't happen, it's constantly trying to drink. How did one stop drinking, since you stopped drinking completely? It's too dangerous. There, it seems to me that she is going fast. Michoie says it all, before avuie, drug issues and alcohol issues aren't so separate. Michoie says it all on that. There's a mom, it comes from too much barley. Because there too, it's a ridge. When I say the ridge between language and silence, or language and the immalness, it's a ridge, it's a maze scrolling by. It's going very well to drink, to take drugs. We can always do whatever we want. If that doesn't stop you from working. If it's a stimulant, even it's normal to offer something of your body as a sacrifice. Very close, it is very sacrificial, its attitudes of drinks, drugs. We offer our body for sacrifice, why? Probably not, there is something too strong. We couldn't bear it without alcohol. It's not about supporting the alcohol. This is perhaps what we believe to see. We need, what we believe we see, what we believe unproven, what we believe we think, which makes us proving the need, to be able to bear it, to be able to master it. We need help, alcohol, drugs, etc. Second. So he makes the border, it's very simple. That's how drinking, drugging, all that, almost senseless, makes something too strong possible. Even if we have to pay it afterwards, that's good. But in any case, it is linked to this, to work, to work. And then, it's obvious that when there are spills and drinking doesn't work, drugs become a way of not working. It is the absolute danger. It no longer has any TV. And at the same time, we realize more and more that, there, we believe CC's alcohol, where CC's drug is absolutely not CC. Maybe you have to have been there to realize that everything you thought you could do, thanks to her or thanks to alcohol, you could do without. So, I really admire the way Michaud says, well no, it's become all that. He stops. Me, I drink of merit because I stopped me when it's because of breathing, health, etc. But it is obvious that it is necessary to stop, or that it is necessary to do without it. The only small justification possible is if it helps the work, even if we have to pay for it physically afterwards. But more and more in 20, the more we say to ourselves that it helps for work. So... Since the start, like Michaud, you have to have done a lot of drugs, you have to have drunk a lot to be in such a state. And on our part, you say, when you drink, it mustn't prevent you from working, but it's because we've glimpsed something that the drink is dissupporting. This something is not life. So there, there is the question, obviously, about the writers that you have a lot. That's life. It's something too strong in life. It's not at all something necessarily terrifying, it's something too strong. It is something too powerful in life. So we believe in a somewhat silly way, because I'm going to put you on the level of something more powerful. If you take the whole line, there are Americans, great Americans. But it's during... The during of what I admire the most is Thomas Wolf. All this is a civil alcoholic. By putting that this is what allows them, no doubt they help them to perceive something too big for. Yes, but it's also because they belonged to something of the power of life that not everyone can perceive. You felt she was at the end of the power of life. That's it. Obviously that's it. It's not Health Hitolfra's alcohol. There was a power of life, in France, for them, but that only they could see. Totally agree. Totally agree. And their lives, the same. Totally agree. Of course. They made one of a real moroccan. That's where the booze is for them. They risked it, because they thought of you because it helps them. I had the feeling that it helped me to make concepts. It's weird. To make philosophical concepts. Yes, it helped me. And then, I realized that it helped me more, or that I was bored, or that I could quickly work on it if I needed to. What should you dance? That's all. It's more of an American tradition, because we don't know a lot of infranchised children who entrust their pensions for alcohol. And besides, we have enough trouble. There is something that is part of the readings. Yes, we have... The writings of infranc\xe9es are not the same vision of writing. I don't know if I was marked so much by the Americans. It is a question of vision. It's clairvoyance. They considered there only philosophy, writing. It's a bit the question of very in all, really in a modest way, even something. Even something that others don't see. It's not quite the French conception of literature. So, I was asked if I had a lot of alcohol, too, in France. But it's still rather off, alcohol, in France. It is a lot of difficulty, finally, that, we know. But we also don't know many philosophers who entrust their pensions. L'Avit\xe9 Ruinolais, very close to here. If we accept a word, we know. When I take the Ruinolais, I say to myself, no doubt, it was Verlene's route to go to the caf\xe9, in his absence. They are there, even dwell at the door-bendminable. That, the poets, yes, the poets, and alcohol, know it better. The literary poet, French, who would trail Ruinolais. It is a wonder. At the friends bar. Yes, in all. Finally, the poets, yes, we know that there have been more... tillites. Alright, we're done with the booze. We will spend enough. So it's vast.\",\"topics\":[\"drink\",\"alcohol\",\"pleasure\",\"sobriety\",\"body\",\"concept\",\"philosophy\",\"power\"],\"length\":9532,\"wordCount\":1725},{\"letter\":\"C\",\"title\":\"Culture\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE  - C comme Culture  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Culture.mp3\",\"content\":\"We're going to spend enough, so it's vast. It's expensive. It's like culture. Yes, I don't think so. So there you are, it's someone who tells you you're not cultured. That is to say that you say that you read, you only see films or you watch things for precise knowledge, the one you need for a precise defined work, which is the one you are doing. But at the same time, he is a person who, every Saturday at an exhibition, will have a film from the great cultural domain. One has the impression that there is a practice, a kind of effort in the culture, that you systematize and that you have a cultural practice. That is to say that you go out, you make an effort, you tend to cultivate yourself. And yet, I remind you, you say that you are not cultured at all. So how do you explain this little paradox? Isn't it cultured? No, to what I mean, when I mean the effect, when I say to you, when I don't invite myself as an intellectual at all and I don't see myself as someone cultured for a simple reason , it's that when I see someone cultured, I'm scared. I'm not so admiring, I'm admiring and in some ways, not at all, but I'm scared someone cultured. It is noticeable when even someone cultured. It is to know, but above all to know effarence. Someone who is cultured, we see that, in a strong mood, a lot, among intellectuals, he collapses everything, he collapses everything, it's not. They are common to everything. It's called the history of Italy at the arbeissance, it's called the geography of the North Pole, it opened up the whole list of it, it collapses everything, it can talk about everything, it's a baby there, when I say that I am cultured, of an intellectual, I mean a very easy thing, it is that I have no reserve knowledge, no knowledge at least, there I had no problem when I die, not to look for what I have published. Nothing, nothing, nothing, I have no reserve, I have no provision, I have no provisional knowledge, and everything I learn, I learn for such a task. And there task done, I forget it so well that if 10 years later, I am forced, then we give each other a lot of joint, if I am forced to a better master in something similar or in the same subject , I have to start over from 0, except for a few rare fours because it's pidosa and in my heart, so yes I don't forget you, it's my heart, it's not my head. But if, then for I don't admire, it's republishing, it's republishing, it's republishing, it's an opinion on all subjects. No, it's not republishing, they know how to travel first through Les Isons, they have traveled through history, through geography, they know they can talk about anything. I heard at the athelix, it's Faros who hears degon, so as I'm full of admiration, I can even say, people like echo, or me echo, it's prodigious. Me, for him ten, well that's it, it's as if my thing is supported enough, and he knows it moreover, it's not at all. So I can't say that I'm aiming for it, I'm spared, but I'm not aiming for it at all. It's a certain way, I tell myself the culture, it's good, it's because we keep me busy talking. Above all, I can't help it, well, as long as I do more lessons than I do their milking, for example, I tell myself more and more, not to leave, it's a little dirty, it's a little dirty , writing is clean, writing is clean, but speaking is that. That's it, because it's charm, it's charm, well I never knew how to wear the school-locke, since I was in school-locke when I was very young, never been able to wear the school-locke. I don't travel, why don't I travel, because intellectuals, me, I travel very well, if, well, I really travel, well, that doesn't bother you, but intellectuals travel, it's rice food What. They don't travel, they move to talk. So they talk to their right where they talk, to go to the other place they go talk. And then even on their knees, they will talk with the intellectuals of the place, they won't stop talking. I am for this not speaking, I am for this not. So as before my life, it seems that it has culture, it is very much linked to speech. In this sense, then I have the culture, I can not stand it. But that, we will come back to separation, clean creatures and dirty speech, because we were a very great teacher, and separation. But that, we'll come back to that, we'll come back to that since it's the being, that there's a professor at your work. And that, we will have the opportunity to talk about seduction again. I have the dare, bobbine, five. A second. Just go. So I would still like to come back to this thing that you have somewhat eluded, this discipline that you impose on yourself, even if you don't need it, in fact, to see I don't know, let's admit in the last 15 days the exhibition of polques remus\xe9es of modern weapons, you go all the same often enough not to say of weapons, of weapons even a large film or even an exposure of painting. So, you're not he reddit, you're not that he's going there, you have no admiration for the people that he's going to you there, as you just said. So, what does this practice, this reform, correspond to? Is it fun? I think not. Yes, of course, it's fun. Finally, it is always fun. But then I think of the stissement of being at the agaires. I don't believe in certain band culture and what I believe in is meeting people. And meetings don't happen with people. People, they always believe that it's people who meet each other, so it's terrible, there it's part of the culture, the intellectuals who meet this conlock jump, all that saie, this woman, but meetings don't happen with people, they happen with things. There are ages encounters on the blackboard, yes, you encounter, moreover, music, I encounter music, yes, I understand that means the right to encounter. When people evolve people in camp, the more I am the right to meet with themselves, with people, there it goes more at all. It's not encounters, that's why encounters are so, so seubindres, it's always disasters, encounters with people. But me, as you say, when I go on Saturday, he says, I'm not sure I'll meet him, but I'm leaving, I'm happy for, isn't there a saddlebag at the same time, a painting, a film, so it's great, I take the example, not except for me. Camps made something, it is a question of getting out of it, it is a question of both staying there and getting out of it. So staying in philosophy is also how to get out of philosophy. But getting out of a philosophy doesn't mean doing anything else, that's why you have to get out while staying, it's not doing anything else, it's not making a robot, first of all I don't will be incapable, but even I will be capable, I believe that would mean absolutely nothing to me. Me, I want to get out of philosophy through philosophy, that's what interests me, that's it. That's to say. I take the example, like all that, it's after my death, I can be without my esti. I've just done a book on a great philosopher called Laineyt, and insisting on a notion, well, that I didn't bring back home, but which is very important to me, which is the fold, the notion of fold. I consider myself to have written a book of philosophies. Well, on this somewhat bizarre notion of a fold. What's happening to me on this? I receive letters as always bays, bank letters. There are incidifying letters, even if they are hearty and warm and touch me a lot, they are letters that say to me, good, you have done very well, they are letters from intellectuals who have hebeo , not the mayor, this book. And then I receive from letters or to the letter, 200 letters, which strike my eyes. There are letters from people telling me, but your fold story is us. It's us. And I realize that these are people who are part of an association, which groups 400% in French. You see the least, maybe they will increase. It is the association of paper folding. They had to review, they had to review, well here it is, reviewed and say, but we are in complete agreement. What you do is also what we do with water. Well, I say to myself, this, this, I have neighborhood. Thereupon, I receive other kinds of letters. And they speak exactly the adventement to go there. They say the fold is water. But it is such a wonder. First, it reminds me of Platos. It's in Platos, the philosophers, for me, it's not at all abstract people, the great low struts, great heights very, very concrete. I have platoons, there is a story that will bring joy, it is that one, and which is undoubtedly linked to the beginning of philosophy, it will thank you will come back, because on that, the head of Platos is he gives a definition. For example, what is politics? Politics is the pastor of men. And on top of that, there are a lot of people who arrive saying, well, you see, politics is water. For example, the bath is obliged to arrive saying, well, I dress men. I am therefore the true shepherd of men. The butcher arrives, tell me I feed the men. I am the pastor of men. The rivals, to the hero, I had this experience a little. Here, the folds, we are not going to trap, which arrive by saying, the fold is water. The others I'm talking about, there, who will see exactly the ventil of being, it's not so much, it's the sorfers. Learn well seen in the case report with the folds of paper. The sorfeurs, they say, we are completely in agreement, us, because what do we do? We know this step of that, if duait in the folds of nature. For us, nature is, it's a set of bop folds, so we stay in the fold of the wave. To live in the fold of the wave, that's what, it's a task for us. To live in the fold of the wave, and indeed, they spoke to the bire \xe0 pleuban, it is already completely. They think, they don't just think, they think what they do. We talk to them about it, also maybe, with if we talk to them, in sport, day by day, the world will talk about it. But that, we started from the meeting, these are meetings. So that's dating. When I say, get out of philosophy, through philosophy, that's a great advice to me all the time, because it's encounters, I've encountered the folds of paper, I don't know need to see them , we would be disappointed, no doubt, I would be disappointed, and I would be even more disappointed, no need to see them, but I met them with surfing, with the folds of paper, so there you have come out of philosophy , by philosophy, that is an encounter. So I think that the encounters, when I go to see the exhibition, it was really, what am I, looking for a painting that touches me, a painting that moves me. When I also want to eat them, not at the theater, because the theater is too long, it's too much of an idea, it's too much, it's too exhausting, it doesn't seem artelle, except in certain cases , except Bob Wilson and Carmelo B\xe9d\xe9, I don't have the feeling that the theater is very, very caught up in our time, but except it's an extreme, but stay four hours to six, on a moment armchair, I can't anymore no matter what health reasons, so it's the theater, that for me. But yes, it has a patio exhibition too, the stockings, but I always have the impression that the bioseur risks meeting him, idea. Yes, but there is none, finally the film by distraction, it is not culture, that. It's not culture, but there is no distraction, that is to say that... My distraction, everything is part of a job. It's shit, no, it's not work. I mean, it's agais, I mean, we've been watching for something happening and saying to me, do you think it finds me, it's going well, it's very funny. It's not dimarfi who's going to trouble, it's not... Dimarfi, he's an American comedian in the latest films, they are real public successes, you'll never see, no, you only watch Benille on television. Yes, Ben B\xe9dille, I'm interested, we have a risk, I'm interested, it gives, that it's not... I'm not saying, it's certainly not very good things, Dermel, that is no reason to interest me. But when you go out, it's for a meeting. When I go out, if there is no idea to antir\xe9, if I don't say to myself, well, he had an idea, what are the great ideas, to sow, that also applies to the filmmakers, what will do me in beauty, for example, I take a great comedal, or like the other, but what touches me in that also in... They are pursued by unified units. Ah but that, which drags the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, the boulevard, there is a rat of all that. Well, we'll stop there, but that's what seems to me to be a meeting. We make encounters with things, it goes without saying with people. It's dating. At the moment, because there are a lot of meetings to talk about a specific cultural period, which was one of... Oh yes, yes, I just said it, the puckers and the surfers, who do you want, more beautiful. That's not meetings with intellectuals, you see, I don't do meetings with intellectuals. Or if I meet an intellectual, it's for other reasons that I love him, and that I want to meet him, it's for what makes his current job, his charm, all that. We make encounters with his elebans, with the charm of the people, with the work of the people, but not with the people, who are almost crazy. There is nothing at all. So the more he can rub like cats? Yes, there is a pool, so that, if, in which, brushing, it was not really horrible. It's you, you have a often, it's good, I say you're a real one. It's good, here it is. Go ahead. So we go back to the rich periods and the poor periods of culture. Yes. And right now, you think it's a not so rich period. Finally, I see you very often, you acted in front of the television, in front of the literary emissions, that we are not mistaken there, although in the moment when that will be diffused, the names will be different. Are you sure that it is a rich period or a particularly poor period, the one we are living through? Bah, he must be poor. It's poor, but at the same time, it's not at all. It's not at all for growth, yes, it deserves because at... Yes, I said to myself, I say it at my age, I say to myself, it's not the first time that there are poor times. I tell myself, what have I been through since I reached the age of Montousiasme and a little... I experienced liberation, that repaid me for liberation. It was the richest period of the period imaginable. We rediscovered everything. The liberation, there had been the war, it was not nothing, it was not a pie. We rediscovered all the rebound in America Kafka. Weeks require discovery, there was Sartre, you can't imagine what was there. I mean intellectually what we discovered, where we rediscovered while beaten, etc. It's here. You have to understand things like the great controversy, should Kafka be burned. It was imaginable and it seems a little late today, but it was really a creative atmosphere, it was a very, very strong atmosphere. I knew before 68 which was an extremely rich period until shortly after 68. When there are periods for your periods, it is very normal. It is not the fact of poverty which is embarrassed, it is the solemnity or the power of those who have poor times. They're much meaner than people in geniuses who fatten up in rich times. They are brilliant at the right ensemble, because we have the day when I saw precisely, we are talking about the Kafka controversy at the liberation. I saw at the exendre thing which was very very happy to say that he had never read Kafka and he said it completely while laughing. They are very happy, the more they are stupid, the more they are happy. It is those who consider that arancion comes down to its tail, literature is a small private matter. If we consider that, we don't need the Erik Kafka there, we don't need much of the Erik there, since if we have a Brown Thursday anymore, we are by nature Kafka's legal. Since it's not work, they don't do work. I mean how to explain, to take things more serious than I jump. I went to see it not long ago, like it's a movie. No, it doesn't have the genre, it was admirable. There is a very moving film in a Russian who made his film 30 years ago, and then he just passed. The Covid-Saint. There, I grabbed something that I didn't see, and that wouldn't be moving. It's that this film was very very good, very good, we can't do it well. Perfect. But we said to ourselves with Th\xe9ror or with a kind of compassion, that it was a film like the Russians were making before. From the time of Aisaine Chythane. In the time of Aisaine Chythane, of Dove Shadecourt, that's fine with you. Everything there you are. Parallel editing, including parallel editing, sublime, etc. It's as if nothing had happened since the war, as if nothing had happened in the cinema. And I was saying, it's forced. The film is good, that's it, but it was very strange. The very beautiful because of that, if he wasn't very good, it was because of that. And literally, someone who had been so alone in his work, that he was filming as we were filming, there was a time rather, it's not that you're down on it. But precisely, it suits you very well, he was prodigious, there was a time. Everything that had happened since, he hadn't known. I tell you, he grew up in a desert. Very poured a desert, it's not much. Very versed a desert, it's not great, very versed a desert period. What is terrible is to be in it. It's growing up in a desert. That's awful. I guess, one must have a feeling of loneliness. For people who are 18 now, for example. Yes, especially when you understand that when things, that's what emmeters in periods. When things disappear, nobody without the person. For one simple reason, it's that when something disappears, it doesn't shade. The Stalinist period made Russian literature disappear. But the Russians will not have perceived. I mean, the bulk of the Russians. All the Russians did not perceive. A literature that was literature for the slope, in all the saying, there are indeed 10 by one. I hear well, well, we are told now, there are dissidents, etc. We are there at the level of the people, a Russian people, it was not raturatism. It takes a turatism, yes. And no one without knowing them. Today, I think I will report on what is happening today. But nevermind, there are obviously new young people who are genius banks. I think, guess, it's a bambaisse expresseur, but guess the new bacquests. Today's new bacquests, I have the sense. I have the sense, there are the new philosophers. Oh, yes, I don't have to not like it. But the new bacquests today. S'suppose not publish them yet. After all, bacqu\xeate has failed well by the published ones. It is obvious that there is demented fear. By definition a big turn of Rua G\xe9bi, which brings something new. If this new one doesn't appear, I don't have anyone without a bank, anyone, since we had no idea. If for where it hadn't... If Kafka hadn't been published, we can't say that Kafka hasn't anchored. If the other had burned all of Kafka, no one must say, ah, like that, from the lack, since we would have no idea what disappeared there. If the new bacquests today are had, or are prevented from being published by the current publishing system, we won't be able to say, ah, like that, no, no, if we did... I heard a statement. So, the statement, I heard, I believe in my daughter, the most important there is, I don't want to say who we preceded it in a newspaper, especially since what I'm sure of it is something thing of the edition, which has to the adhirs, you know, today, we are more likely to make errors like Gali-Mar, time more and more prousts, because with the means which we have, I make you. Dear head shorts, dear head shorts. We dream, we dream, the means we have today to find the new proustes and the new bacquests, in other words that we would have a counter that is perfectly unimaginable, since we don't know what didn't kill us new ones, and one dreams a meaning if one... Did it go over that head? Yes, yes, we passed it, we have that. So what defines the crisis today? It's all those tricky codes, that's it. The crisis today, I see it linked to three things, but it is hard to pass, I am very, very optimistic, that's what defines a period of losses. It is first that journalists, in case they have form a book. Journalists are always writing, I find it very good that journalists are writing. But not in a long time, when the journalists are put to make a book, they felt that they passed to another form, that is to say that it was not the same thing as to write their article of day-your. We can even consider that for a long time, it was the writers who were journalists, badly armed, they could do journalism. But the reverse did not produce. Here, it's the opposite. The journalist, as journalists, is a book, that is to say that they find it very normal to make a book like that, which is hardly a leg artier. That's not good there. The second reason is that it generalizes the idea that everyone could write, because writing was everyone's business. So, with the family archives, either arche, writings, or archive. either archive in the head. Everyone had the love story, everyone had, like a sick grandmother once, a mother who died in terrible conditions, we say to ourselves, that's a meal. It's just that it doesn't make a meal at all. But really not at all. So... And then... The third reason is that... You know, real customers have changed. And that we hardly notice it, except people, except of course. You are aware, but... The customers have changed, I mean, the television customers, that's who... It's not the listeners anymore, the television customers, it's the ads. They are the real customers. The listeners, they have... They have what they want, the announcements... The spectators. Spectators, yes. Gilles de l'ose, seventh bobbine. Wait a minute, that's not the plan. Before... Just a moment, that's true. And then the third reason, what is it? Well, says to himself, yes, the ads are the real customers. There is more... And so, I was saying, in publishing, well... And there is a risk, which is that the real customers of publishers are for potential readers. It's the distributors. When distributors are truly publishers' customers, what will happen? What interests distributors is the rapid rotation. Fast turnover means big market stuff. Quick rotation, best salary scheme, etc. That is to say, the whole idea makes up for it. If I tell you with the stick, all the creative rature idea, will be crushed by nature. But does that already exist for you? We preform what are the needs? Yes, that's what's going on. That's what's slipping away. The drought period, that's a pivot bowl. It's indulgence, it's literature, it's indulgence. The provision any literary criticism, commercial promotion is given. But when I say this engagement, it's obvious that... Where will there be parallel circuits? At circuits, there will be everything on the black market, there will be this land. It is not possible for a people to live in Russia. She lost her literature. She is racy. She will conquer it. She recounts all that, puts it away. The rich periods are our periods for... So, it's... Unhappy poor. On this idea of walking parallel or of the black market, the subjects have been performed for quite a long time. That is to say that one year, for example, we see very clearly that in the books that come out, it's war, another year, it's the death of parents, another year, it's is attachment to nature. In fact, that's how it is. For nothing, an alert to form. And the begins to resurface. You have already seen a pot period reappear, rich with a pot period. Did you attend? Yes. Once again. After the liberation, it is not strong. And then there were 68. Between the great creative period and the liberation. And the start of the new wave sequence is 60. 70. The 9th. Between 72 and 72. But so much there was a new, rich period. Yes. He uses it very well. It's a bit if you want, that's what Unit says, I'm fine. Someone throws an arrow. He shoots an arrow out there in space. That's it, or even a period, a collectivity, throws an arrow and then it falls. And then someone comes to the mom, it's sending. It's how it works like that, creation, literature. It passes on desires.\",\"topics\":[\"culture\",\"intellectuals\",\"knowledge\",\"education\",\"desire\",\"body\",\"philosophy\"],\"length\":25064,\"wordCount\":4489},{\"letter\":\"D\",\"title\":\"D\xe9sir\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE  - D comme De\u0301sir  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Desire.mp3\",\"content\":\"So, hope, we'll go to D on these entrofettes. Oh yeah ? So, for D, I need my paper, because I'm going to read what's in the redhead. A little redhead illustrated in Duleuse, who is also crushed with a D. So there is Duleuse, Gilles, French philosophy, neaparied in 1927. 25, sorry. I was done in the red, not the gold, huh. Here, today, we are in 80 luches. All before they... With Felix Guatari, he shows the importance of desire and its revolutionary aspect in the face of any institution. Even since analytical. And he puts, as they demonstrate in all this, the Antillean d'y, during 72. So, precisely, since you pass in the eyes of all for the philosophers of desire, I will have how one speaks of desire. So what was desire, exactly? Take the question, quite simply, of the world, when the Antille d'y... Yeah, it's not sure. It wasn't what we thought, anyway. Filer, it's not what we thought, but well, at that time, even I say it, the most vocal people, well, who were... It was... It was a great ambiguity. It was a big misunderstanding, all the same, a small misunderstanding, all the same, a very small misunderstanding. I think we meant one thing, but really very simple. If we really had a great ambition, namely that... until that, when we write a book, it's because we claim to say something completely false. We pretended that in one way or another, the people before us, they hadn't really understood what desire was, that is to say, we were making an octage of philosophers, we claimed to be proposing a new concept of desire. But in concepts, you mustn't believe that... People mustn't, when they're not doing philosophy, believe that a concept is very abstract. On the contrary, it sends things back extremely, it's an extremely concrete appeal, we'll see, it's... almost it sends back. There is no philosophical concept that will render to non-philosophical ends. It's very... It's very... Very very concrete. We wanted to say something simpler in the world. We meant, until now, you speak abstractly of desire, because you extract an object supposed to be the object of your desire. So, you can say, I wanted a woman, I want to leave, to take such a trip, I want these that. And we were saying a very simple thing. Really, simple, simple. You never desire anyone, or anything. You always want a set. It's not complicated. And our question was what is the nature of the relationships between elements for there to be desire, for it to become desirable. I mean, I don't want a woman. There, I am ashamed to say things like that. It's proust, there, d'y... It's beautiful, I have proust. I don't want a woman. I also desire a landscape that is wanting to pay in this woman. Landscape that you need, I don't know, that I sense. What if, since I hadn't unrolled the landscape that she blopped. I wouldn't be happy, that is. My desire will not be stupefied. My desire will remain satisfied. There, I take a two-tier set, a landscape woman. It is quite another thing. When a woman says, I want a dress, I want that, such a blouse. It's obvious that she doesn't want such a blouse in the abstract. It is desire in a whole context, which is a context of her own life that she is going to organize. The desire will have bearing with, not only a landscape, but with people who have his friends or with people who are not his friends, with his profession, with, etc. I never desire anything from everyone. I want, much more, I don't want a set, either. I desire in a set. So, there, we could come back, it's at the end time. There, we were talking earlier about drinking alcohol. But, to drink, that never meant to say, I desire. I want to drink. So there. Where does that mean? I want to drink alone while working or drink alone while resting or go find friends to drink. Go to such a little cafe. In other words, there is no desire that doesn't flow, I tell myself, that doesn't flow, that doesn't flow in an assemblage. It's good that desire, for me, has always been, if I look for the abstract term that corresponds to desire, I would say, it's constructivism. To desire is to construct an arrangement. It is building a whole. The set of a skirt, a ray of sunshine, a street, that's it. The arrangement of a faint, of a landscape, of a color, that is what desire is. It is therefore to construct an assemblage, to construct a region. It's building, it's really agency. Desire is constructivism. I say, we, the whole thing is said, who is that, there are others. We have to do it, yes. It is precisely because it is an assemblage that you need, you needed, at that moment, to be two, to welcome that it was in a whole that Ph\xe9lix was needed, who appeared at this that moment, of the uncreated life. Would Ph\xe9lix, there, that would also be part of what we might have to say about the profession of the relationship of philosophy with something that concerns the profession, but surely that with Ph\xe9lix, we have make an arrangement, yes. We can, there are agencies all by itself, once again, there are agencies in 2. Ph\xe9lix, all we have done, Ph\xe9lix, is an arrangement in 2, or something passes between the two. That is to say, all that is physical phenomena. It's like a difference, for an event to happen, there needs to be a difference in potential. For there to be different potentians, make two levels, there must be two, at that moment, something happens, a flash passes or not a flash, or a stream, a small stream, well, and it's from the lady of desire. As desired, it is quite built. Constructed, however, each of us passes without a track, constructed, each who says, turning, each, someone who has said, I desire this, that means that he has entered to construct agencies. And it's nothing else. Desire ringing, look. You are still waiting. Not of my silk that in truth. You're going to do it anyway, go for it. So precisely, it's a coincidence if it's... because the desire has been proven, finally, exists in a set, where we're going to only arrange, the Antille of hyp, or you speak of desires, or you... How is it going to talk about desire? And the first book you write with someone else, that is to say with Felix Guatari. Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. It's a fallin' tool, where we enter into this arrangement, new for us, writes Radou, which has been... Which is... the same way. For something to pass, that is to say that there is what she wants to pass, it was ultimately a hostility, a reaction against the dominant conceptions of desire, the psychonalitic conceptions. It had to be egg, Felix goes into apsychonalism. Me, being interested in this subject, it took all that for... We say to ourselves, there was reason to make the conception, well, constructive, constructivist of desire. Yeah. And could you better, like that, define rather quickly, successively, how you see the difference between, precisely, this constructivism, interpretation, analytics, well, we can clearly see, but there are... Oh, that's all. Me, I think that's all. I will say our position, apsychonalism. It is multiple, but when there is a problem of desire, it is because, really, the apsychonalist speaks of desire, exactly as priests speak. He doesn't know the only one, it's not the only connection, it's priests, it's priests, the apsychonalist. They talk about it in what form, they talk about it in the form of a great complaint about castration, what. Castration is worse, it's worse than the original sin, castration is a kind of curse on desire which is truly appalling. So, what did we try to do, we, in the antiter, said, I believe there are three points. There are three points which arise directly for the apsychonalist. These three points are... And there, for my part, and I believe that neither Ph\xe9lix nor V\xe9l\xe9gisouatari, we have absolutely nothing to change, it's three points. It's that... that we are convinced, or believing, in any case, that the unconscious is not a theatre. It's not a place where there's been a chard who's staggeringly playing their scene. It's not a theatre, it's a factory, it's production. The unconscious is produced. He produces, it doesn't do without a product. So it works like a factory. It is the benevolent opposite of the psychonalitic vision and of consciousness as theatre, where things always linger on the sidelines, or on the infinite team. Our second theme is that delirium, which is closely linked to desire, when desire is delirious in a certain way, but if you look at any delirium, if you look at our press, if you hear about delirium whatever it is, it has nothing before on the apsychrialising of a burp of seduce, that is to say, one does not delirious on his father and his mother. And we're delirious about something completely different, and that's where delirium is created, we're delirious about the anti world. That is to say, we are delirious about history, geography, the etribue, the helper, the epupe, the climin, the airace, the ecliban, it is on this that we are delirious . The world of delirium is... I'm a beast, an agro, a handsome. It's where the tribes are, how to arrange the tribes, survive in the desert, etc. The desert is the delirium and geography of copolitics. And the apsychrialis each time, it reverts to family determinations. So I can say, there, I feel, even after time of years of distance, after him whole, I say, the apsychrialis of a chaperian understood, a pleasant fact of delirium. We rave the world, we don't rave about our little family. For that, all that, it overlaps, when I said literature, it's not someone's little private gift. It amounts to the same thing, delirium too, it's not delirium about the father and the mother. And then the third point is that it comes down to the room of irres, it's that delirium is always his, he builds agencies, he's his in an arrangement, he always goes play several factors. And the apsychrialis of 16 of ours comes down to a single factor. He always the father, sometimes the father, sometimes the mother, sometimes the necessary, etc. And there, everything has a rank of what is multiplied, there, everything has a rank of constructivism, that is to say of agencies. I will give examples. We were talking about food earlier. For the apsychrialis, food is an image of a father, but your... A chouin is an image of a father. It's crazy in the world. I am thinking of the example of the petitance. The petitance is a child on whom, Freddon, his opinion, he assists a chouin in the street who falls and the chartier who lives the age of whippings. And the chouin who kicks, who kicks everywhere, well, before the car, before the automobile, it was at the show running through the streets. Must have been something for a kid. The first time that a kid travels, I do, who falls in the street, and that... that cuddled half drunk, tried to lift a whiplash, but it must have been an emotion. It... It got to you... It happened to you on the street. That has you... The event in the street, sometimes all of that was a bloody event. And then we hear, it's the \xe9psicale at ease to speak, finally, imagine a pair, etc. But it's... It's in their head that it's wrong... The desire, that the desire was concerned by a chouin of the grave and beaten in the street. A death cabbage in the street, etc. But it is an arrangement. It's a fantastic arrangement to be... It's too white all the way to the bottom. Another example, I can say so... Another example... We were talking about the animal. What is it to the animal, but there isn't... An animal that would be an image of the father. Animals generally, it goes parm\xfbte. It's musts, good. It's musts. There is a term that pleases me very much, it is very very that I adore. It's... It's Jung. It is who agrees with Freud after the long collaboration. Jung will account to Freud that he had a dream of another night. He dreamed of an osseware. And Freud does not understand anything literally. He tells her all the time. If you dreamed of a bone, it means... Someone's death. It says to someone's death. And really Jung, in 16 of him, I'm not talking about a bone. I dreamed of an osseware, an osseware. Freud does not understand. He doesn't see the difference between an osseware and an osse. It tells you an osseware, it's... It's a bone. It's a thousand bones. That's 10,000 bones. That is multiplicity. That's an agency. He's a... He's a probing twin in osseware. What does that mean? What... What is it through which desire passes? In an arrangement, it is always a collective. Collective, constructivist, etc. That's desire. So where does desire pass me, among these thousand crates, these thousand bones or pass me desire in the pack? At what position in the pack? Am I outside the pack, next to the pack, in the pack, in the center of the pack? These are all phenomena of challenge. That's desire. But this collective arrangement, precisely, like the Anti\xe9die Petalif which was written in 72, it was a collective arrangement, arrived at the point named after 68, that is to say that it was a whole reflection of those years- there, and against the apsychoanalysis which continued its business of small-desires. And nothing to the opinette what to say, the delirium, delirium, the \xe9rasse and the tribes, he delirious the peoples, he delirious the history and the geography, well for example, to have been completely comfort at 68, it that is to say, having brought there, it seems a bit of erre-saint, of which all this is contained, malseurs, delusions that occur, people, we have seen that it is delirious. If I get delirious, it's about reading about my child, we have it too, about my little private affair. We rave about cosmic delirium, we rave about the end of the moment, we rave about particles, about electrons, but not about pas-pamant, of course. Gilles de l'oeuvre, Bobbin Nuff. One second, I'm serious. Like, you can go out a little bit. There, when you want to go. Precisely, concerning this collective arrangement, of desire, I am thinking of certain misinterpretations, I remember that 20 years ago, in the 1972s, at the faculty, there were people who put into practice this desire, it rather gives rise to collective loves, it was not very well understood. And I, I would like, or even more precisely, because there were a lot of crazy things before the scene, like you started from a schizo-analysis to fight psychoanalysis, everyone thought that it was was good enough to be mad, to be schizo. Then, one saw of number one true similar per thousand students. And I would like you to tell me, like that, some funny or less funny stories of his misinterpretations about desire. But the misinterpretations, I rather applauded the dirafs-stretois, the misinterpretations tinted in two things. There were two cases, it will come from elsewhere, even. There were those who thought that desire was spontaneity. That's good, there were always spontaneous movements, spontaneity. The spontaneous words, the famous ones. And then the others who thought that desire was a party. So, for us, it was the anillotre, but that didn't matter much, because... Anyway, there were agencies for them to do, there were things that... Even the crowds, crowds, crowds, there were so many of all kinds. That was part of what was happening to oneself there, to going to that one. But the crowds was... They had their discipline, they had their misguided friend. They did their discou, they did their interventions, and also, they train their agencies. They had their agencies, but they deal with them very well in an arrangement. They were... They had some kind of Russian, understanding, great possessions, crowds, and so on. But at the level of theory, practically, it was a decent agency. He was getting... They were getting loose. Theoretically, the nonsense, you're told, marouille, desire, is spontaneity. So we were called, the spontaneists, or else it's party time. But that wasn't it. That's you... The philosophy of idudesia, that consists in a bark to red years. But don't get psychologized, never interpret, experiment with agencies for years. Look for years agencies that suit you, that everyone is looking for. So what the hell are you doing years ago? Me, I would say an arrangement for me. And... F\xe9lic, that bothered you... It's not that they thought otherwise, because... It was perhaps my astegages, it's not for me. The matiadric, there were four components of agencies. If you want, I am... Finally, very big, that there is not a four more toxic. But, an assemblage, that will send to states of affairs. Let everyone find the state of affairs which suits him somewhat. So, later on, for me, I meet such cafes, I meet such cafes, the people who are at such cafes, and so on. That is a state of affairs. In terms of layout, edons\xe9es. Of the types of edonses, the each styles, it has certain saddlebags to speak of. He's... Okay, so that's archoal. In the caf\xe9, for example, there are friends, and then there are some badi\xe8res to talk to friends. It's not... Chacca makes a style sound. Oh, I say there are cafes. But it also goes for a whole other thing. So, an assemblage, that one brings about states of affairs, and edonseas... styles of elanciation. For example, it's really... It's very interesting. History is the effect of 50, isn't there such new type of slender? For example, in the Russian Revolution, the edonsies, the Ledidist type, when did they not see as in what forms... In 68, when did they not see the first edons\xe9es, said of 68, it is very, very complex. Finally, any agency, it applies styles of elanciation. And then it involves territories. Each has its territory, there are territories. Even when we are in a room, we choose our territory. I give a piece that I do not know. I am looking for the territory, that is to say the place where I will feel the organic in the room. And then there are processes, which must be called deterritorialization. That is to say the baguelle in time goes out of the territory, in the kind of good. I would say that the arrangement satisfies these four dimensions. States of things, impulses, territories, territorial movements, and it is in this that desire flows. So... It mustn't start from the fact that there are really responsible people who have apprehended drugs. We have them too literally, the Caribbean says, because that's not a problem, I would say, it's not like... Cato who encourages young people to do stupid things. We are always responsible for it. But what were the effects of Antille said? Me, I've always tried to make it work, well... Anyway, I never believe, it's good, it's my aneur. I've never been clever, that's the thing. I never told a student, drugs, you, your reason. I always did what I could to get them out of trouble. Because I'm too sensitive to the tiniest thing that suddenly makes it sound, that suddenly makes someone fall into a state of investigation, that drinks very well. There, you, I've never been able to in red times, I who do, I don't like computers. But I think you have to be very careful about the weight where it can go. Who drinks, who takes drugs, who does what is worth. We're not cops, we're not an idea, I'm not supposed to prevent them or... But do everything so that they don't turn into a state of oc. So, when there is a risk, that, I'm not... I'm not very much someone who takes drugs, and someone who takes drugs like this, who takes drugs, I don't I don't know, the savage in such a way, that I tell myself that's it, he's going to crack. I'm not especially a young guy, you talk about people, I'm not into the young who cracks. It's not supporting, that. A cracking old man, who's so... Well, he's seen his life. But someone young who cracks with caution, it's possible, me too, because that's where you are. So, I've always been torn between the possibility of proving someone wrong, and there, the absolute desire, where the absolute refusal, that they turn to the state of the oc. Well there too, it's a parade base, you know. I can't say that there are principles, we feel like we can shock. We try, it's true that the role of people, to oneself there, is to try to save the little gloves, as much as we can. And saving them doesn't mean we're going to get the law taken, it means preventing them from becoming lakes. That's all I want. No, but it was about the effects, the effects of Antillia, because we had people at the UN. That's it, it was prevented. Good, sin, that it turns there, that to oneself there, what is or that a guy who develops, finally, a great beginning of what they offered said, either in tape condition, that we don't put him in a repressive hospital, all that ... he stops, let him stop... Because it was all the same a revolutionary book insofar as it seemed for the enemies to follow the little channelers as an apology for permissiveness and to say that... It's all the solid edicts, you have this, this book has never... That is to say when you read this book, this book has always marked a caution, it seemed that it is very low. No, become... There, the sound, that's you... No, don't become lakes. When we are imposed, we know this opposite step, the process that offered us to... To the type of hospital. And for us, the terror was to produce a hospital creature. It's not all that. And I would almost say... Selling the kinds of values of the journey of what we called, of what we have the antipsis, which caught up with the journey to the process that offered us access to it... It was a way to avoid warding off the production of hospital lakes. That is to say the production of fresh skits. The manufacture of fresh skits, right? Do you think to end the hype Antille that this book is still effects now? Yes, because... That's a good book. It's a good book, not if there's a conception of the conception in my opinion. This is the only case where there was a conception of concernostics. I say, on the two points, where the three points. The multiplicities of concern, delirium as world delirium and not family delirium, cosmic delirium, racial delirium, tribal delirium. That is good. And the concern as a machine, as a musine and not as a theatre. I have nothing to change, the C3 points. And in my opinion, remains absolutely new, because the whole psychoanalysis is reconstituted, and that gives... So, for me, I hope that there is a book that we will rediscover. Maybe, maybe, I don't pray that we rediscover it.\",\"topics\":[\"desire\",\"unconscious\",\"psychoanalysis\",\"machines\",\"assemblage\",\"becoming\",\"multiplicity\"],\"length\":23061,\"wordCount\":4005},{\"letter\":\"E\",\"title\":\"Enfance\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE  - E comme Enfance  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Enfance.mp3\",\"content\":\"Bobbi told me this. Claire, wait, you watch 30 seconds to concentrate. 10, 70 and 8. Great. Claire, it's up to you. So, them, it makes sense. You always say you started your life coming from Vagram. You are in the 17th arrondissement. Then you live with your mother Rudobini in the 17th district. And now, you live near the place that chiste, to say a poorer neighborhood, in the 17th arrondissement, a biseurde. We can say so, since he will be dead at the moment of his remarks. So we can give your address. So, I would like to know, first of all, was your family what we call a bourgeoisie family, a bourgeoisie family of rights, you know what? I always say, I always say, I've lived when I'm asked. Because it is true that it is a fall. I started from the top of the 17th. Very boudix 17th. And then, in my childhood, I experienced the crisis before the war, that, I have memories before the crisis, I was not tall, but one of the memories was the name of an empty apartment. You were gambling with way more money, and there were rented apartments everywhere, everywhere. So my parents had to approach the beautiful apartment at the top of the 17th, near the Ac de Triomphe. And then he coated himself, it was still not bad. It was not far from Voulot-Valzerbe, a small street, the R\xe9do-Bini. And then, when I'm back from the Pairie, et toi, grand, the extrefronti\xe8re of the 17th, but it's the 17th sonic part, a bit prolo, the rue Nallel, the rue all that, and not far, the house was Verlaine, who was by Hiche. So it's a fall, in a few years, I don't know where I am anyway, but it's not going to get better, all that. It's you ? Yes, to that, you. But my family, my family, was a heuist family, a middle-class family, on the right, no, because where on the right, yes, it's certainly not on the left. You have to put the situation in order, but open up to children, I don't have many. I don't have many, because even memory fades away, it's more of a faculty that should push back the past than the wound. Memory, it takes a lot of memory to push back the past, precisely. It's not archive. So, I have this memory, there were even fittings, where there were fittings with flat on the ouet, all that. The crisis, I experienced a lot. What year was I? Ah, this day, I tell you my years, it's not between 30 and 35, that 30, I do more. Finally... What was I 10 years old? People had more money, I was born in 25, yes. So, but I remember, and he cared about money. That's what saved me from going to J-8. I put down. That's not more money to me. I was decided at D-8 and then I was in high school. Because there was the crisis. But the other aspect is more, there was another aspect of the crisis that I remember. It's more, there is another aspect, but not very close. And then there is war. He won then my father, yes. It was a family indeed. When there is a family on the right, yes. Because... That, I observed very keenly. They didn't come back. That's why I understand the bosses better, some bosses now. The terror they kept from the popular front, which is something unbelievable, the cross. Popular front, it is... Even without doubt, perhaps bosses who did not live. But then they must remain still who have not lived. It's... For them, it's the St\xe9b\xe9nibace of the Pyrg-68 tile, the popular front. And I observed someone, all this right-wing bourgeoisie, saw the symptom of an anti-S\xe9byte iso, all of them, and... and Blou, it's some sound of... Defending hatred. If you want hatred, that... Invite me France. Had on the back, but is nothing. Nothing nothing. On the hate side, which Blou will pick up, because Blou was really the first. Paid vacation was... Faring the reaction paid vacation. The first leftist Jews. Ah... Blou, that was... Yes, that's you... That's your... I don't know, worse than the devil, that's your sign. We don't understand how P\xe9tain could have... could take power. There is burden if we do not see the level of antice and pithism of France at that time, of the French bourgeoisie at that time, the hatred of the social measures of the Blou government, that was. .. it was the farant. When my father, he was a bit on fire. Yes. There, there. Good, but it's very common for you at this deproc. There, in the fact of the right familiar, a cult, there is a cultivated bourgeoisie. So. Me, it was quite a cult bourgeoisie. Complete a cult. But my father, she was I believe, on fishing. No, but he was an exquisite man. He was very careful, very good, very charming. And me, it seemed quite surprising. It's this violence against... They came from the war of 14. It's a world that we understand very well on the whole, but we can't imagine the detail. It's old from the war of 14. At the same time, the antiseritism, the regime of the crisis, what was this crisis that nobody understood anything. Finally, there it is. He was on the job. He was at G\xe9liore. He was very, very special at G\xe9liore. I saved two glue activities. He was... Did he invent at Le P\xe2ne or did he use the watertight roofs to produce cider \xe0 rang? The tangeities of the roofs. But with the crisis, there was only one worker left in N'italia. So, in addition, a strange thing, it all worked very badly. And then the case fell apart. He relocated to a more serious industry that made balloons, trics, airships, arm pipes. But at one point, it was absolutely useless. At point 19, he had some in high family to stop the German planes. I know why, but it really was like carrier pigeons. While we get out of the factory where at work is mounted, they have been more resolvable, they have converted everything into the manufacture of pneumatic gifts. pneumatic gifts, it was more efficient. And they didn't make balloons and eplanes. And me, I saw this descent of the war. I saw that, I have a great sigh to say, I didn't like you. In any case I was 14 years old, the way people knew very well that they had gained a year, that with Munich, that they knew gained a year, a few months, when they were the war. Well, it was linked, the crisis, the war, all that. It was maybe less, it was a very tense adventure. I did not forget a little bigger. Live members at expense. Bit bin 11. One second. Yes, whenever you want. When the Germans really arrived, we passed Belgium, descended on France, all that. Me, I was in d'auville because it was the place where my parents spent the holidays. Always the holidays were. And we were them, they had already returned. They left us what was unimaginable. We had a mother who never left us. But the cons\xe8re was in a boarding house. And gave us an old lady who owed a pension. And I did a year of schooling at d'auville, in a hotel that had become a high school. The Germans weren't long. Ah well no, I cruffons everything. It was during a phoney war. Yes. I was in high school at d'auville, it had always been, when I was talking earlier about paid holidays, I don't remember all the more that the arrival of the first paid holidays on the beach of d'auville, she was something for a man of the cinema. It should be a masterpiece. Because when you see, it's like seeing the hand for the first time. It is prodigious. Me, I saw someone who saw for the first time in his life. The mother much later. It's splendid. She was a little girl from the Limousin who had been with us and who had seen the mother for the first time. It's true that it's something unimaginable when you haven't seen it, it's the mother. We can say before the mother. It's something grand, something finished, but we don't put anything on it. But when you see the mother and this young girl remained, I don't know four bags in front of the mother, completely stupefied as if she were an obedience idiot. And she doesn't have it, it's not in front of such a sublime, such a grand spectacle. Well, then, that implies opinion. Which was a flage reserved for people for a long time. Luckily, it was their property. Really, paid holidays and people who are us, you had never seen the mother. And it was grand. If class hatred is anything, it's words like elase. My mother, who was nevertheless the best of women, said, I am able to frequent a flage where there were people like that. So it was very hard. They never, me, I think, the bourgeois they never forgot. But 60 then, you have nothing to say. The meals, the fear they had that you were going to voice later. Fear, like you're not there to be. From now on. If we have holidays for the workers, it was all the bourgeois privileges that disappeared. And the places, there too, are preliminary questions. If the good ones did everything. Good, on the pressure vessels at the beach of our cities. It was, I don't know, all of a sudden, it was the dinosaur's turn. I don't know, it was an assault. It was worse than the Germans. It was worse than the calming times coming on the beach. In France, it was indisputable. It was an opium people. Especially since it's a detail. But what was happening in the factories, not really. They never forgot that. They were still, they were scared and repeated. I don't want to say that 68, the inviinities, 68, it was something else. But they didn't lose, so no more worries, only 68. Anyway, I was in our towns, without parents, with my brother, all that. That the Germans really broke it. So yes, that's where I know, it's trials. I mean, I was a young boy. It would be very mediocre, hoarsely, of interest to only an interest to believe that it is. I was, I believe, collecting stamps. It was my highest activity. And then I came, the class. And I had what happened to a lot of people. I think we're still... I don't know the people who are awake at my hand. They are always woken up by someone. And me, there was, in this hotel, there was a young guy who will seem extraordinary, because he spoke very well. And that was the absolute wake-up call for me. It was lucky to fall on a guy. In this type it was then relatively well-known. First of all, he had a father, a little famous. And then he did a lot of activities in the warp. But much later it was called Hanvax. It was Pierre Hanvax, the son of the sociologist. He was his very young one. And he had a headache. He was very thin, very tall, a little tall. I believe in my memory. He only had one eye. Meaning, he had one eye open and the other closed. Not by nature, but he stood like that. He was a bit of a Cyclops. He had a goat that wanted to curl very much like a goat. Yes, more than like a sheep. And he owed to the cold, he owed to or via the fact. He was in extremely fragile health. It's good that he was reformed. And he tele-sensed, and that we had put teachers there, during the war, to fill the... And that was a revelation for me. So he was hovering in 12th. I know much more in some of these. I am during 4th and good in 3rd. And he communicated to us. Finally, he communicated to me something that... It was good, verse that we can see. I discovered something. He spoke to us about the skin of the air and he read us very well. And we bonded. It's good, not if he saw well, that he impressed me enormously. And I remember there is a level. So on the beach at d'Oville, he puts some on me. I remember, I stuck it to the letter. I was his disciple, I have you. I will find a master. And we sat on the dunes. And there, in the wind, the sea, all that, this theme. Sometimes he read to me. So I remember. He read me earthly foods. There is a person on a beach in winter. He cried earthly food to her. I was also next to him. I was a little frozen if someone arrived. He had, I thought, it's weird, all that. He read to me, it was very varied. He makes me discover an atolle France, Baudelaire, Gide, I believe that this goodness, the main ones, are great loves. It's great love. But I was transformed, absolutely transformed. So that it got people talking pretty quickly, this guy with the lure who had it, this big scale, and all that, this range he followed everywhere, they went on the beach together, all that. And me, at the game, it is very quickly worried. He made me come. She said that she was responsible for me, in the absence of my parents, that she warned me about certain relationships. I did not understand anything. I did not understand anything. If the place of pure, questionable and avoible relations, it was indeed that one. And I understood it only afterwards, it was assumed that Pirel Vax was in the BD-RASSE game. So I tell him, I'm annoyed. I obviously saw you, he's killing me, you're yais, I said, I said, I said you mustn't see that all that isn't normal, it's not comfortable. And he tells me, listen, don't worry, no lady, no old lady can resist me, who says, I'm going to explain to her, I'm going to go see her, it will be very reassuring. And me, I was just to those clever ones, he had given me back, it's really there for me to have my doubts. I was not at all calm by that, because I had a pressing y bank. It was not at all sure that the old landlady, and indeed, it was a disaster. He had gone to see the old landlady, who immediately had to write my parents, that it sharpened you Urgen, they made me come back, that it made you an extremely suspicious individual, so he had completely missed his shot. But there are really the Germans when they arrive, yes, all that was the big war, the Germans arrive more for their own good. And my brother, we went by bike to find my parents who were taken to Rochefort. The factory moved to Rochefort, that is to say to escape the Germans. So we did that by bike. I remember seeing the speech of the state again, the famous infamous speech, in a village obege, all that, then we put on T\xe9a V\xe9lo. And a crossroads on which fell a car, the computer of the cartoons, where he had the old alvax, the son alvax, a beautician who was called Bayer, at the time. And they went not far from La Rochefort. It was a fate. Alright, all of that. But then, I recount the sequence to say that with a loan, I found alvax. I knew him, I knew him well. I had more admiration for him. It's true that good. But it taught me at least something. That's me, when I was 14, 13, 14. And it was when I admired him that I was right. I have coil twelve. So you're going back to Paris? We'll hear you in Paris. Then, you return to Paris with some difficulty. We read his carnals, since the maquants are finished, there, in the Two Wars. And there, we read his carnals. You're doing your philosophy classes. I think in high school at that time, there was Marlowe Ponti, who was a teacher. But you, strangely, you are in the class of a teacher who is not Marlowe Ponti, you are with the other teacher who is called Monsieur Vial. It seems to me that you told me that name. Yes, Mr Vial. Yes, yes, there, I kept it, I tell you, very, very overwhelmed. But there, it was a coincidence. I was distributed. So I could have tried going to Berlowe Ponti. I have not done. I do not know why. But Vial was... That happened to him a maximum effect with a path something of what was the literature. But from the first philosophy classes, I knew that's what I would do. That... I remember scattered things like that. For example, I remember very well. I was in philosophy when we learned about very powdery comics. We love it. We love it, it wasn't safe. There was a kind of... It must be said that I was in the class, it must have been a class that was a little... politicized, a little sensitive to questions, an Asia, etc. I was in Guy-Banquet's class, I remember. And there was a funny atmosphere in this class. In any case, it's a year of rador. It was something hitting and boys of 17. I don't know who at age did. His bachouge no longer knows. 17 18, no, 17 years old. It says 17 years. 18 years old, there, normal. I remember very well. So Vial was a teacher. He spoke very low. He was old, and I liked him very much. He doesn't know me. So, from Berloponti, I weld him with melancholy. Because no, it's a big high school where there is a balustrade that goes all the way to the first floor. And there was a very melancholy gaze from Berloponti who watched all the scales below, who played, who screamed, a great melancholy. It's emblisse, I say, what the hell am I doing here. As long as you say Vial, there, let me expand, he made that career, and there too, I had a lot of ties with him. Very very related. As we live not far away, we don't tell each other diamonds. We don't talk about it. And there, I knew that either I would do philosophy or nothing. And from the first shots. Yes Yes Yes. Yes, it's as if you want, when I learned of the existence, there were things as strange as what we called concepts, it had the same effect on me as for others, the meeting a character from a fantasy novel. God I was put off, for example. The account of Monte Christophe. Monsieur Charles Luss, a great character in a novel, where wallows one or anything, where I said grandet. When I learned, I don't know myself, even things like, what Plato called an idea, it seemed so alive to me. Also lively too, I knew it feels like you, feels like you to me, feels like it to me. And you were immediately very good, the best? Yes yes. There, I had taken the school problem. Since Alvarque, I was good. Since then, I was good, I was good, even in Latin, even in... Yes, I was good. I was a bordel\xe8ve, and in philosophy, I became a very bordel\xe8ve. And I would like us to come back a little bit too. She was not at all politicizing the classes at that time. You say, something a little special was happening in the fact that class, since there were things guillemok\xe9... To politicize, it couldn't have been the war. He was not politicized. There were surely boys who turned 17, 18, were resisting. And those weren't conditions. The people who made resistance existed with less crests. So, we can't talk about politicization or not. There were indifferent people, parties in d'wichy, and there were... An awakening French action? And no, no, a French action. It has you much worse, it has you bichy, or, it has you... So we can say... No, it has no comparison with politicization in so much peace. Then on the active elements, really, it was resistance, young resistance fighters, or young people in relation to resistance. So it had nothing to do with politicization. It was much more secret, much more... For example, in your class, there were people who were sympathizers, young people, who were already sympathizers with the resistance, and who spoke. Yes, I'm quoting you, said, monquin, who had died, I believe, who was associated with the Nazis... a year later, I believe. But do you talk about it? Oh, of course, yes. Just as I tell you, the mediate noise, communication and the mediate of Radour, it was the theme communication, it was the theme, you are an essay, it was the theme. It became known, I believe, the same day, that we were going from here, via lesia, no, known. That's for me, there are things that are more moving, learn it, afterwards, learn, Radour, as if immediately. So, to put an end to childhood, if we never end it, precisely, your child, it seems to have little importance for you, that is to say that neither everything speaks , nor is it a reference, we do not have the impression of a great importance of childhood. Yes Yes Yes. Doing your hands, okay, it's almost a bit of a function of everything we've just said. I really consider that the activity of creations cannot be said to have anything to do with its own business. Not at all that one does not put all his soul into it. Literature, in depth, scriptures have fundamentally to do with life. But life is more than personal. Everything that doesn't matter in literature, something from the person's life, from the writer's personal life, is by nature angry... You naturally have it, since it prevents him from seeing, that preventing him from you is there, that won't have him, surely, his little private affair. It was never that, me, my childhood. It's not that my way time. What would bring me, if need be, is just as we said, there are become ransimals that their hand goes opp, there are become rannimals, and writing, I believe, is always becoming thing. That's why we don't write to write, so no more. I believe that one writes because something of life passes through you. Whatever it is, there are things that... We write for life, that's it. And we become something. To write is to become. But it's becoming anything you want, except becoming a writer. And it's doing everything you want, except the archive. So as much as I respect the archive. There it's good because we do archives, but it's not... it's of interest, only in relation to something else. Compared to something else, if there is reason to make archives, it is precisely because there is something else. And that through the archive, we will perhaps grasp that there is something of this other thing. But the very idea, for example, of talking about my childhood, seems like a thought because me, because it has no interest. But that's because it's the opposite of all the hiterature. It is contrary. You are purely... Me, I read a... I've read that a thousand times already, what I'm saying everyone has said it, all the writers have always said it. But I come across a book, I know it, I don't know, everyone knows too much, a close friend, mandel-stame. So I read yesterday, precisely, as I said to myself... There is a very beautiful first name, can you read the comment? Also, yes, also, no. He says in this sentence, it's equivalences, it's a type of brake, it bowled me over, it's a type of brake. And that's what. The role of a teacher, that's it, it's communicated, a text, done, well, a text, a degamin, that's what it does for me. Good, good. He says to him, there's something I don't understand, I don't know exactly, it's writers, I've never been able to understand people like Tolstoyle, even Tolstoyle. Lovers of family archives with their epics of household souvenirs. This is where it starts to get serious. I repeat, my memory has no love but hostility. And she works not to reproduce, but to record the past for an intellectual of mediocre origin, like him. Memory is useless. He just has to talk about the books he has read and his biography is done. Like me, with Alvaq, that fat guy. There, at the dear of happy generations, the popes by their exams and in chronicles, at home, is thus held in a gap. And between me, there is an abyss, a skew filled with noisy time. What did my family mean? I do not know. She has been ring of descent and forgives herself with something to say. On me, on many of my contemporaries, weighs the stuttering of birth. We learned not to speak, but to busier evil. And they are decomposed to go to the increasing noises of the century and once whitened by the listening of its crest that we have acquired a language. I don't know about that, that really means. To write was to drink from life. It was boigner for life. It was to work on their thumb, in the sense in which they said it, for the beasts that will have me. It's babble in the language. Doing literature, appealing to childhood, is doing the typical, literature is a small private affair. It's disgust. It's the beasts, it's the real shit. If we don't push him to this point, where he yawns, because it's not easy, it's not enough to bathe like that. If we don't go that far, maybe it's in the literature, just like afford to push the engage to a limit. There is an animal becoming of language itself and of writing. There is also a becoming child, he becomes a child, yes, but it is not his child. That, the most childhood of anyone. He is the child of the world, he is the child of a world. So those who are interested in childhood, they will make themselves, and then they continue, they make the literature that deserves. If someone does not know how to interest in his child, it is Proust, for example. Well, the writer's floor isn't delved into the family archives. It's not taking an interest in one's child, that, no one is anyone to take an interest in, no one worthy, worthy of the cross whatsoever to take an interest in one's child. It's another page of becoming a child, through writing, arriving at a childhood of the world, restoring a childhood of the world. That's what that is, that's a level, that's a level of literature. The child does not care. The child beats, there is another company knew it, that considered from his mother, everything is known all the writers knew it. She doesn't need it. It has become, yes, my jale, if I can't manage to find another formula than that, and writing has become well, but it has become neither writing, nor its own memory, nor this whole that, no. And it's not because I had a love affair that I'm going to do it again. But it's filthy, think of it like that, it's not just media, it's filthy. So an exception to the rule is that Natalisa Roed, who is an animator, is a writer writing an alive called \u201cIn France\u201d, she has a little weakness. But not at all, at all. There I am very late in opinion, Natalisa Roed is animating, it is a writer. In France, it is the product of the book of his childhood. It would be typical, not a book, testified. And I've played the voque before. You are well understood that you played the v\xf4que at the range, but it's a very dangerous role and you don't understand that. Is it a real gender? She invents a childhood of the world. What interested on my childhood, Natalisa my pipe? It's a certain number of tirotipated formulas from which she will work wonders. It could just as well be what she did with... Is that the second era? The last words, or whose last words again? From Chekov. Chekov's last words. She's going to shoot in front... She's going to shoot from... Ah, little girl, someone's been saying for a long time, how are you? So what is it how are you? How is she ? She's going to get my language out of it. It will cause language to proliferate on itself. You're still talking about all that. Interested in her childhood, Natalisa Rote. But me, I don't mind all that, but all the same... The other one Rote, you would respect his childhood very much. It's what ? It's a matter of the soul. Yes what is it ? But me, I want all that, but at the same time, first of all, it's a training from the first hour that pushed you towards literature. That is to say, you repressed your childhood. You repelled him as an enemy and as hostile. First, from what age, is it training? And on the other hand, childhood comes back well by puffing, even if it's puffs, drippings. That is to say, childhood. So, is it necessary to have an almost daily training or a daily discipline? That's all of it, I guess. Because childhood, childhood, childhood. It's like everything, it would be necessary to distinguish a mafesse in France. It's a good childhood. I call, what's interesting? Good, report with the father the mother and the memories of childhood or sense of heart, one can go my mother. Doesn't sound very interesting. It does not seem interesting and very rich for itself. It really doesn't seem like a very expensive piece of writing. There are other aspects of childhood. I was aiming earlier, achemalme, in the argue, before the cars. It rediscovered the emotion of children. He's a child. So. It would be necessary to say the child that I was, it is nothing. But I'm not just the child I was. I was a child among others. I was an ordinary child. And it's always a title of some kid that I saw that was interesting. It's not under, I head such a child. I saw a choice to die on the street before there were automobiles. I'm not talking too less, but for those who have seen it. Well yes, it worked very well, very well, perfect. Perfect, it's a task to become a writer. Perhaps a factor which made that, of Otso\xefevski, the avu, there is a large page of Otso\xefevski. I believe in writing my chatters on the path that loses itself in the street. Nijinsky, the dancer, the view, Nijitslava. He's seen chatter before. When he has viaturage, I believe. I'm opening it like this. Well, it's going very well. And you, have you seen the demonstrations of the popular front? Me, I saw the demonstrations of the popular front. Yes, I saw my father struggle between his annoyance, his anti-Semitism. So. I was a child. I have always called ie on the meaning that includes not the meaning of the indefinite article. From a child and beaten, axe, badly and whipped, etc. It doesn't mean me, it means. The indefinite article is the edoriche is extrehensible. It's all the multiplicities. We come back. It is multiplicity.\",\"topics\":[\"childhood\",\"memory\",\"experience\",\"time\",\"becoming\",\"multiplicity\",\"body\",\"concept\"],\"length\":29352,\"wordCount\":5369},{\"letter\":\"F\",\"title\":\"Fid\xe9lit\xe9\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE  - F comme Fide\u0301lite\u0301.

Loyalty to talk about the job, since you have been with Jean-Pierre Bamberg\xe9 for 30 years and not a day goes by, its what you call or you see. And it's like a coup, anyway you're loyal to your profession, you're loyal to Felix Guatari, to G\xe9r\xf4me Lendon, I'm going to quote... And the I, Jean-Pierre Bamberg\xe9, to Pierre Chevalier, your friends are very important to you. And Fran\xe7ois Ch\xe2telet, or Michel Foucault, who were your friends, you will have paid homage to him, as to friends, with great fidelity. So I would like to ask you, this impression that loyalty is necessarily linked to the profession for you, or the reverse, and fair. It's not just fidelity, yes, it's like a plus ocean at F, but fidelity is something else, yes, fidelity is something else. The profession for me, is a bed of what heart, it is for me, it is the inferno of perception. Here too. It's the fact of... It's not that we have common ideas, but what does it mean to have something like that with someone? It's an idea, not unity, we understand each other without having to explain ourselves. It's not from common ideas, but we have a common language, or a pril common language. There are people who don't take anything from what they say, even if they say things like that, even if they don't say, I'm the only one, I mean what is saying that? On the contrary, there are some, he talks to me about an extremely abstract subject, and I don't agree with them, I understand everything. I understand as well, that means, I'm going to tell them something, and they have something to tell me. And it is not at all the community of hesitation, which there, it is a mystery. It's what it's indeterminate funds that makes... Well, well a 14, are you in detail? Is it talking about the story? Oh good, yeah. So yes, it's true that... There, there is a great mystery, this fact of... having something to say to someone, without tendency, there is without a common idea, without compensating for me. is not it ? I have a hypothesis is that ... every year we and apt to grasp a certain type, I had no one to grasp all types, at once, a certain type of charm, there is a perception of charm. And what do I call charm? There, it's for the whole thing where I want to bring some monsexuality back into the profession, there, not at all, but a gesture from someone. Someone's thought, even if it is before it is significant, or someone's gesture, someone's modesty. It's solder chargers, when they go so far to the girl, to the vital roots, that that's how you become someone's mis. If you take sentences, well, from someone, there are sentences, there are sentences that can be said, that if the person who said it is vulgar, or indieable, a type of sentence, we you have to look for examples for the time, then every year there are examples. For me, for each year of us, there are sentences, if you hear a sentence in style, you say to yourself, God, what am I hearing? There, what is it? If the world, you must not believe that you can say a sentence like that by a-sale, and then he caught up, there are sentences that cannot, and conversely, for the charm, there are sentences but quite different, who are going to be loaded, who show a certain delicacy, you say, but, there's you, this one, he's mine, not the center of ownership, he's fine, and I hope be more extinguished, be there, the trade, the trade perhaps. So, there are many questions of perception, to perceive something that suits you, that teaches you, that takes you out, that wakes you up to something. Yes ? That's it, that's it. Now, you say very well, there is only that. Someone who is a good sign, we receive them, we don't receive them, we have them well, but all the inhabited ones, I believe, are fairly based there, and also sensitive or put there by someone. I think that's what explains it. So, nature, we can't, it's someone who comes out to bring it back, or preferably in 10 years, it's for 10 years things completed, you, significant, in 10 years, generally, in 10 years, things. It's comedy, the job is comedy. There are a lot of comedy about couple of friends in repeated bouverts, or quests, thank you for... With Jean-Pierre, I say to myself well yes, we are pale reproductions of Merciel and Kabien, yes, it's ... It's... It's... Jean-Pierre, he's me, I'm tired all the time, my health is fragile, Jean-Pierre is hipocombre, and a conversation is very , indeed, Merciel and Kabien, what we were saying, the dialeau of how you are, and the other answer, I'm pumped up, but not completely pumped. There, it's a sentence so dear, somewhere, that we love, to the one who said it, how are you, like a cork, not the autity, not the sea, well, that's it fee, fine. With the lines, it's different. With the lines, I won't be Bercier and Kabien, I'll be more... I don't know... You were hit on me at the World Cup. We threw ourselves, when he's in everything we've done, we leave in our work, we threw ourselves into an attempt, we got knocked out, it's really... c he's of the Rattian type, we have the same brand of hats, and then, the attempt, the encyclopedic attempt, to construct a book, which tackles all knowledge, with another, we will move on again, from orelernia, I don't don't mean that you have to imitate, it's a great couple, but that's what living in it is. Great friends, it's beautiful, we're going to pass it on, it's Kabien, thank you, it's the orelan, even if they are disputed, scrambled, it can bring. Yes yes. So obviously, in the question of the profession, there is a kind of mystery. I mean, it's about the three philosophy pipes. That's the philosophy, as everyone notices, there's put into the word. I mean that philosophy surpasses itself, first of all to please everyone, and it presents itself literally as a friend of wisdom, there is a friend. What the Greeks invented was not wisdom, it was very bizarre friends of wisdom. What can he mean, friend of wisdom? That's the problem of what is philosophy, what can it be friend of wisdom, we mean that, weight. It means that it is the passage of wisdom. So obviously, there is an easy interpretation, he owes you wisdom. We're not going to... What inscribes the profession in the philosophy and what type of friendship? Does it have to... Is it related to a friend? What's wrong with you? What does that mean, friend of wisdom? I say once again, if we have an interpretative like the one who is towards you, it is indeed the one who claims wisdom without being wise. But pretender to wisdom, it means that there is another who pretender, is never the only pretender. If a suitor has the girl, there are several suitors. It's that the girl has several suitors. Aren't you promised, aren't you promised wisdom? You are not promised wisdom. I claiming wisdom. But then, well, there are pretenders to wisdom and Greeks that they invented, that's the advance, what they invented is the phenomenon of pretenders. That is to say, what they invented was the idea that had rivalry of free men in all fields. Elsewhere, the idea of rivalry between free men does not exist. But in Greece, yes\u3060\u304b\u3089, the locances, for that, that they are so procedural, it is the rivalry of free men. They are trials of free men. Friends are lawsuits. In any case, young boys or women have suitors, Penelope's suitors, there are suitors. That's it, that's the Greek phenomenon par excellence. For me, it's not the miracle, the Greek phenomenon, it's the rivalry of free men. So, that explains to me the philosophy, he claims, there is a rivalry towards something, towards what. So, we can interpret if you take the history of philosophy, that, there is that for which, indeed, philosophy is linked to this mystery of the profession. There is what is linked to the mystery of betrothed. But maybe it's not far, who look. The fianc\xe8nes will sing more, they don't have the philosophy on the fianc\xe8nes sailleront, without the first love. I zign\xe9, but how we said earlier, the first love, it is perhaps the repetition of the d\xe9radi\xe9, it is perhaps the last love. There is the philosophy, maybe the couple had the important thing in philosophy, it's very curious. Me, I don't think we get tired of it, that it's only philosophy, that we can settle our questions with it, of finance and of the friend, what is that? friend, all that, that's what's very interesting, it's going away, in fact, very interesting. And Blanchot, in the profession, he has grown a little. Ah, but Blanchot, it's white part, play me what we have. It's typical, it's the two current men who, in relation to philosophy or even thought, give importance to the profession. But in a very particular sense, they do not tell us, one must have a friend to be philosophers or to think. They consider that the profession is a category or a condition of the exercise of thought. That's what's important. It's not the made friend. It is because friendship as a category is a condition for thinking. Whence the male relationship in such, for example, whence the relationship whence Blanchot's declarations on the job, can bring that the envage would have rather comidated that I adambe wary of the friend. For me, she put her. It is reinfiance. An hour ago, there is a glass that I adore, that I love very much, that I appreciate very much, a poetal, which is between Chia and Lou, the hour at which is challenged. Chia, between Chia and Lou, the hour at which you have to blunder even about the friend. An hour ago, you have to blunder even about the friend. Me, I don't trust my leggings, like the plague, I don't trust my friends. But I'm wary of it with your gang, I thought he could do bad things, because when he does, it's very funny, very good, very very. No it's. There's such an understanding, there's such a community between friends, or with the fianc\xe9, or with me, I don't mind anything. But if you want, you mustn't believe that all that is events, small private affairs. There too, it's when we say inhabited, when we say the lost fianc\xe9, etc., these are, it's a question of knowing under what conditions thought can be exercised. For example, prouste considers that the trade is 0. Not only for him, for his account, but perhaps for thought, there is nothing to think about in the trade. There is a reverse thought, in jealous love. This is the condition of thought. I would like to ask you the last question about friends. It seems that with Foucault, Ch\xe2telet is yet another case, since you were his friend when he was liberated and you did all your studies together. But with Foucault, you have a friendship which was not that of a blow of which you have with Jean-Pierre or with Felix or with Ely, or with Jerome, since one will speak again a crowd of enclosures jumped from the others. With Foucault, the profession was very profound. Yet she was distant. She had something much more formal for someone who was exterior. So what was this friendship? It was surely that he was the most mysterious for me, maybe when it was when it was too late, maybe Foucault, it was a very big regret for me. And since I had a lot of respect for him, I was ready to try to... Must say, until I got him, I was going to perceive him and it's one of the rarquats of the soul, which entered in a room, it changed, it changed the atmosphere. Foucault is not simply a person, moreover, none of us was a person. It really was like an air, another air, like it was a special draft, and things changed. There was no more... It was really atmospheric, where there was a sort of emanation. There was an emanation, Foucault, there was... Because someone sees radiation, there was something to associate it with, it spreads what I was saying earlier, it was streets -nats. There was no need to speak with him. We never talked about something that made us laugh, and it's seeing someone, and saying to each other, not even having to say to each other, that's what makes us laugh today, that 'we are almost what happens, what makes us laugh in all these disasters, what makes us... Oh, there you go, what is he. But Foucault, it's for me, it's the memory of someone who is... Yes, so when I talk about someone's charm, someone's gesture, Foucault's gestures are amazing. Also, well, gesture, that's a bit like the gestures of metal and dry wood. It's very strange gestures for you, fascinating gestures, very moving, very... We're finally going to see each other. ... That people have charm only through their faumie, that is what is difficult to understand. It's the side, it's... The real charm of people, it's the side where they lose, the faggots, it's the side where they lean very well, they are, it doesn't want to say that they collapse on the contrary, it is people who do not collapse. But if you don't get it, the little racide, the little gran, the madness, it's someone, you can't put them on. I can't put them on, it's the side where he's completely, somewhere, we all put on, we all put on a little... a little insane. If you don't get the little crazy dot, it's someone. So, I'm afraid where I dig on the contrary, I'm glad that someone's point of destruction is either the source of his charm even goes. Yeah.\",\"topics\":[\"fidelity\",\"friendship\",\"loyalty\",\"relationships\",\"philosophy\",\"language\",\"thought\"],\"length\":13780,\"wordCount\":2415},{\"letter\":\"G\",\"title\":\"Gauche\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE  - G comme Gauche  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Gauche.mp3\",\"content\":\"Where am I from? From where I have. It will take. And then there, it's not the demon point that constitutes your charm, because it speaks to it of the very serious thing, it's your apartment, that's the left. It's the art of bringing it to life, and I'm very, very happy. So, as we have seen, you are here from a right-wing and elaboration middle-class family which is rather what is called a left-wing group, well, at least quickly. First of all, many of your friends, many of you who were philosophy students, on the PC or are very much linked to the PC, on the release. To all they have passed, yes, what is it? I believe. I believe, I'm not sure. All of them passed. There, how did you kill and chaper? It is for such good complicated, to them, all the friends pass to the PC. Me, what will prevent it? It's because I think I was very hardworking. And that I didn't have the meetings. That, I never liked. Meetings talk endlessly. All that, I never supported. So, all the same, being from the PC at home, it was meetings, it's him all the time. It was the time, even, Jers, once, the landmark, it was the attendants of the Stockholm call. All that, he spent a long time, but when they had a talent and gold, he spent my days of effort getting the shovel of Stockholm signed, by a priest, by a door-what. They were walking around with the Stockholm shovel. I don't even know anymore that it was the Stockholm eupel. But it recovered. And finally, all of a generation of comedy, here, there, I had problems. I had told of hearing stories binds. I knew a lot of comedy historian, full of talent. And if they did the brace, it would be much more important for the comedian party, which at least would have work at a good price than the used ones had signed the shovel of Stockholm, the shovel of the p\xeene on the shovel, or what is not what. And I had no desire. I wasn't a talker, I won't talk, and so, getting the Stockholm shovel to sign, that bit into the balance sheet from a state of panicky shyness. I hadn't had anyone sign anything. In addition, I had to sell them, the humanities, all that, it's for very good reasons. I don't know if I didn't even pose for myself, I had no desire to join the party. We came out close to their engagement. From the party, no, it's a sabage to disconcert me. This is also what will be found in the member. Discussions about Stalin, all that, what we recently discovered about the horrors of Stalin, well, everyone in the country knows it. I will say them all the time. That revolutions go wrong. It doesn't matter to me, not that, finally. Who we miss. When the new philosophers discovered that revolutions go wrong. You really have to be a bit stupid. They discovered that with Stalin. Then the way was open. Everyone discovered it. For example, the proposal is to abandon the revolution to G\xe9riar\xe9e, from Ati\xe8de to Basel to turn not so antir\xe9 on the students. Finally, who ever believed that revolutions turn out well. Who said, they saw, we well the English, so they weren't about to make revolutions. It is absolutely false. But all that currently, in town, in such a mystification, the English have made a revolution. They killed their king, etc. Yeah, yes. And what did they have, like her? And what is English romanticism? It is the ambitation on the failures of the revolution. They did not hear that UXMAN to reflect on the failures of the Stalinist revolution. He loves it. And Americans never have two. But the Americans failed in their revolution. At least as much if donpire as the Polsheviks. It will not hurt Americans when they, even before the Pandemic War, present themselves as a better than a new nation. They passed the nations. Exactly, as Max said, from the proletarian, they overtook the nations. The nations ended. They bring the new people. They are making the real revolution. And just as the Maxists counter on universal proletarianization, Americans count on universal emigration. They are the two fans of the class struggle. It is absolutely revolutionary. This is Jefferson's America. It's TOROS' America and it's Melville's America. I did his, TOROS, Melville, all that stuff. It is revolutionary America that announces the new man. Exactly, as the Bolshevik revolution heralds the new man. She screwed up all the fair revolutions, everyone knows it. We pretend to rediscover it the madwoman of the Biles. So everyone laughs about it, it's current revisionism. There is a furait who discovers that the French revolution was not so good. There is okay. Yes, she was free too and everyone knows it. The French Revolution, it gave Napoleon. We make discoveries that are less exciting because of their novelty. The English revolution, it gave cromboelle. The American Revolution, she gave co-op. She gave frependie and she gave rigane. It's not. It doesn't seem so much more fabulous. So, I say to your confusion that revolutions fail, that revolutions turn out badly. But that never stopped people. Nor does it prevent people from becoming revolutionaries. We mix absolutely different things. Situations in which, the only way out for man is to become revolutionary. Again, we talk about it from the beginning, finally. It is the confusion of becoming eglistory. And if people become revolutionaries, yes, it is this confusion of historians. Historians, it is in parliament the future of the revolution, the future of revolutions. But that's not the question at all. So he can always go back too, to show that if the future was bad, it's because the bad was already at the beginning. But the problem we were discussing, how is it that people become revolutionaries? And that, fortunately, the historians prevent it, one cannot. It is obvious that South Africans are caught up in a revolutionary process. The Palestinians are caught up in a revolutionary process of becoming. If someone tells me afterwards, at M\xe9vouver\xe9, when they have made plans, if their revolution succeeds, things will turn out badly. It's true, at first they won't be the same. These will not be the same kind of problems at all. And then, well, it creates a new situation. Again, there will be revolutionary devils that are triggered. Doing it with men is in situations of tyranny, of oppression, it is effectively, they become revolutionaries there because there is nothing else to do. When we are told afterwards, it all goes wrong, we are not talking about the same thing. It is as if we are speaking two absolutely different languages. The future of history is the current future of people, it's not the same thing. And this respect for human rights, which is so fashionable today, is not becoming revolutionary, it's the opposite. And this respect for human rights, it's really, we want to become present under the proposals, to the gods, it's... It's so much part of this thought of this soft thought of the poor period we were talking about. It's pure abstraction. Human rights, but what are they? It's pure abstraction, it's empty. This is exactly what was said earlier for the deci, that is to say for the deci. The decision does not consist in erecting an object, in saying that I desire this. One does not desire, for example, freedom, etc. It's... it's zero. We open up in situations. I take the current example of Arbenia. He's all...all...reincentive. What is the situation? Get it, are you okay? Will correct, but if we don't correct, it doesn't change much. There is this clave time in another Soviet Republic. There is this median claveur time. There is an Arbenian Republic, there is an enclave. It's a situation. The first thing. There is this bassacre, only Turks, semblances, species of Turks, the quarter. As far as we're concerned, I guess that's it, my coronation of Iain's armies once again. In the enclave, the armies of Iain are reconsidering. In their Republic, I suppose to Correct all my errors and there you sink into the ground. We would be in the Marquit de Sade, to go through the worst for you. The worst ordeals of the d\xe9som, and hardly Isarie, there, sheltered, it is nature that gets involved. I say, we say human rights. These are speeches for the intellectual, and for the high-god intellectual, and for the intellectual who has no idea. First, I notice that always these declarations on human rights, they are never made on people who stop. Nian armed societies, Nian army communities, etc. Because for them, the problem is not human rights. It's what ? What have we done? When I said the irres, it's always through agencies. There you have it, an arrangement. What is possible to remove Stonclan or to make this enclave livable? What does Stonclan give? It was a question of territory. It's not a human rights issue. It's land organization. What are they going to assume Gordnacht heats up and get out of these situations? How is he going to ensure that he is not Stonclan, that Averb\xe9dienne delivered the role to the Ture that Benatze up around? It's not a question. I would say, it's not a human rights issue. It's not a question of justice. It is a matter of case law. All amominations that subillomes are cases. They're not abstract rights dismantlers. These are horrible cases. It seems to me that it is a little overstated, but it is the situations of jurisprudence. The Armenian problem, typically what I will be called, an extremely complex game-exprudence problem, what to do to save the Armenians and even the Armenians to save themselves from this crazy telecent situation. Or what's more, this earthquake gets into it. Earthquake, good, which also has its reasons, the constructions which were not good, which were not done, that twenty-twenty, etc. All of that is case law. Agin for freedom tell me air revolution. And it is done in case law, when you go to justice. Justice does not exist, human rights do not exist. What concerns jurisprudence, that is the advance of the law. So, those who are content to recall human rights and remain human rights, but they are stupid. It's about creating, it's about enforcing human rights. It is a question of advancing case law. Or for everyone, this will no longer be possible. It's very different. I'm taking an example that I really like because it's the only way to make people understand, because it's that case law is something that will no longer be possible. And I understood nothing. Finally, by all that, I understood not very well. I would like to call the time when the smoke in the taxis. Before the smoke there. There was a time when we weren't allowed to smoke anymore. The first taxi drivers who banned smoking, it made noise because there were smokers. In any case, I have always been passionate about case law. By law, that's what got me... I wouldn't have done law, but precisely not human rights. I will make case law. Because that's life. That means there is no human right. There is life. There are rights in life. It's only one per case. And There you go. So taxis. There's a guy who doesn't want to be banned from smoking in a taxi, a taxi lawsuit. I did very well because there, I had taken care of having the grounds of judgment. The taxi was condemned. Today, no way. There would be the same trial. It would not condemn the taxi. It would be the man who would be condemned. But at first the taxi was doomed. Under what expectation, that when one who took a taxi, he was locat\xe8re. So the taxi user has been assimilated to the locator. The tenant has the right to smoke with us. He has the right of use and support. It's as if he was doing rentals. It's like he's going to take. He has been remapped. You're not going to smoke me in your house. If I am a tenant, I can smoke at home. So the taxi has been assimilated to a wheeled apartment. So is the use locatere? Ten to later. That is absolutely universalized. There are hardly any more taxis. You can smoke at number what. The taxi is no longer assimilated to an apartment rental. It is assimilated to a public service. In a public service, we have the right to ban smoking. It's all case law. It's not about 3 this or that. It is about situation and changing situation. And to fight for freedom is really to make jurisprudence. There the example of Armenia will attack me the typical one. Human rights. You have a bit that human rights, what does that mean? It means to the Turks whose right to sacred the Armenians to me. The Turks whose right to crowned me the Armenians. Then we moved on with that. It's really stupid. Or else I think it was really so much hypothites. There all alone thinks the rights of man. It's zero philosophically, it's zero. And the creation of law is not declarations. Creation in law is jurisprudence. There is that it exists. So fight for jurisprudence. We are going to come back to two things that are related to man. That's what's on the left. It's very straight. I there the work, Bobin 17 and last in principle of the day. Yes. It is well considered. So let's take the question again. We were this philosophy of human rights. But is respected by all for human rights. Now it's like a renegade of my 68s. A renegade of my 68s and a renegade of Marxism. So you didn't have to repudiate Marx since you weren't a communist. You can still use it. It's still a reference for you. And my 68, you're one of the last people there. She is voked 68 and she does not want to say that it was zero, a ch\xe2u and that everyone has changed. I would like you to tell me a little more about my 68. And all that, now you are severe in 10 years. I am a jerk. There is a lot of people. There are only around us and our friends. I know very few... There is no Ren\xe9ka. But it's I have a friend. Yes, but there are many. Let him make no renunciation of it. It's almost understood. There, the answer is quite simple. Either in 18, it is the truss of the Dove-Lig. We sometimes wanted to see the Ren of the imagination. It is absolutely not imaginary. It's a whiff of reality at the stage. It's Rene. That's the whole thing. The Reneka arrives. People including not. They don't tell themselves what it is. Real people, finally. People in their reality. It was prodigious. And how about you like in their reality? Well, it's the Dove-Lig. So there could be bad fates. All that. That the hesi historian is not well understood. It's forced because I believe so much in the difference between history and the Dove-Lig. It has a revolutionary Dove-Lig. Without a future of revolution. So we can always laugh. We don't care once it's over. It was phenomena of pure becoming that took people. Even animal becomings, even becomings in French, even becoming women of men, becoming men of women, all of them. It is this very particular obedience around which we have been turning since the beginning of our questions. This is what has become for me. In any case, it is the intrusion of becoming. And you, did you really become a revolutionary at that time? Live revolutionary. Yes, just your smile makes you think it's not his motor skills, tell me sooner. But what is left? It's more the story of telling you. I asked you the question between. It's between your civility, left-wing men who want to, and all that. And therefore become a revolutionary as you have a man on the left, how you manage. And what is left for you? Yes. Me, I'll tell you, I don't think there is a left-wing government. For that, there also, one should not be astonished the government which reteur\xe9 of government of left. And what is a leftist government? It is not that there is no difference in governments. And there is at best what we can hope for, it is a government favorable to certain demands, or reclaves of the left. But a government of the left is not negligee because the left is not to make a government. Me, if we said how to define, she of the left or how to define the left, I would say in two ways. There are two ways. And there too, it is fully. It is, first of all, a matter of perception. There is a matter of perception. The matter of perception is this. It is, not being on the left, what is it? Not being on the left is a bit like a postal address. From sister, the street where you are, the city, the country, the other countries further and further. We start with ourselves. Insofar as we are privileged, in ladies, a rich country, we tell ourselves how to make the situation last. We are coming who has dangers. It won't last all that. It's too demon that... But how to make it last? So we say where? There, the Chinese, they will make his nuts better. But how do you make Europe of Europe still appeal to you? Edegou is the opposite. It is to perceive, so it is said that the Japanese perceive like that. They don't perceive like us. They first perceive the turn-turn. So he would tell the world. The continent putting Europe, France, etc., etc., rue de Biserde, me. It is a phenomenon of perception. First you see the horizon. We perceive on the horizon. It's not out of generosity. Yes, but just that, you're not objecting by... It's not a reason. By there, they are on the left, by their direction, of postal address, they are on the left. First you see the horizon. And you know it can't last. It's not possible. It's a billion people who are coming to an end. It could last another 100 years on these streets. You mustn't tease. It is absolute justice. It's not moral. It is beyond perception even. If we start with the beautiful, with these left bleeds, by knowing, and in a certain way, called from his views, and considered that these are the problems to be solved. And it is not simply, we must reduce the birth rate. Because that is a way of keeping the privileges of Europe. It's not that. It's really about finding arrangements, finding agencies, mounting them. So indeed, the problems of tirs-mands, to be on the left, is to know that the problems of tirs-mands are closer to us, than the problems of our neighborhood. It's really a matter of perception. It's not a question of belame, all that. And no, that's having a left for me. And second, a leftist is to be by nature or rather to become, it's a problem of becoming, of passing here, of becoming a minority. That is to say that the left is never in the majority among the left. And for a very simple reason, it's that the majority is something that supposes, even when we vote, it's not simply the greatest number that votes for such a thing. The majority, it supposes a stallion. In the West, the standard of presuming any majority is an adult man, Marle, a citizen of the cities. Rapoul\xe8s, our joy, are things like that. It's perfect yes, that's the stallion. So we will have the majority by matur, the one who has so much or the whole, such a mother will carry out this stallion. That is to say the sensible image of the adult man, Marle, citizen of the cities. So that at the limit, I can say the majority is never nobody. It's never nobody, it's an empty stallion. Simply several people, a maximum of people on start in this empty stall. But in itself, the standard is empty. The man, mom, etc. Women will count and will intervene in the majority or in secondary minorities, according to the engro, not when not tired of going. But besides that, what is there? There are all becomings that are minority becomings. Women are not a given, they are not women by maturity. Women have a becoming woman. Suddenly, if women are going to become women, men too, they have to become women. Earlier we were talking about animal becomings. The children, they have a becoming child. They are not children by maturity. All these becomings there, that's the limit. Men are not going to become men, it's hard. Ah well no, he is a majority stallion. It's empty. Man has me as an adult, he doesn't have a future. They can become women, they are there, they engage minority prostetus. The left is all of the prost\xe9tus but to become a minority. So I can say literally, the majority is nobody, the minority is everyone. That's it, there are two lefts. It is knowing that the minority is everyone. And that's where it is, it's facts, even becoming. That's why all the thinkers who are, they had this case in democracy of doubts about what we call elections. It was the well-known good thing.\",\"topics\":[\"left-wing\",\"politics\",\"revolution\",\"resistance\",\"desire\",\"becoming\",\"difference\",\"body\"],\"length\":20697,\"wordCount\":3652},{\"letter\":\"H\",\"title\":\"Histoire de la philosophie\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE -  H comme Histoire de la philosophie Part I.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Histoire1.mp3\",\"content\":\"And welcome. So H is H... I'm a man, I'm framed. What did we do? What did we do? H is H as in the history of philosophy. We are used to saying that there is in your work a first stage devoted to the history of philosophy. From 1952 you are created a study on David Hum, please books on Nietzsche, Kant, Berksson and Spinoza. Those who hadn't read you and took you for a commentator were very surprised by the logic of meaning, difference and repetition, and of course, the antiedie, p\xe9pil plateau. As if there had been a hidden mystery that had meddled in Jekyll's doctor. And then everyone was explaining Marx, you immersed yourself in Nietzsche. And then where everyone had to link Reich, or read Reich, you turned to Spinoza with his famous question and you can still today in 1988, you come back to Nietzsche. What did you like and still like about the history of philosophy? You didn't make it complicated because... that also engages philosophy itself. I will say, I guess a lot of people think that philosophy is something very abstract and a bit for specialist. I so visually had the idea that philosophy, to have a specialist, is not a specialty, or the air, in the same sense as painting, than music, that inevitably the problem, I seek to oppose it otherwise. When we believe that philosophy is abstract, the history of philosophy is abstract to two degrees, a second degree since it even consists more in speaking about abstract ideas, it consists in forming abstract ideas on abstract ideas. And if you are another way, in fact for me, the history of philosophy, it has always been something else and here I come back to painting. I think discussions in Van Gogh's letters found discussions about portrait or landscape. I'm going to do the portrait, what the portrait, you have to come back to the portrait, they attach a lot of importance in their conversation, in their letter, portrait and landscape. It's not the same, it's not the same problems. For me, in the history of philosophy, like a kind of empature, it's a kind of portrait tree. We make the oportrer of a philosopher. But we make the philosophical portrait of a philosopher. I mislead a mediumistic portrait as well, that is to say a mental portrait, a spiritual portrait. So well, it is an activity that is fully part of philosophy, just as the portrait is part of painting. All of a sudden, the fact that I send painters pushes me a little bit. If I come back again to painters like Van Gogh, like Gauguin, there is one thing that touched me, enormously about them. It's the kind of enormous respect, even of fear, of panic, not only respect, but fear is panic in front of the color, having to approach the color. So, it's particularly pleasant that it's not being the two that I quote, to maintain to them, are among the greatest colorists there are. But if we go back to the story of their work, to approach color, but it's done with real tremor, they're afraid. And the whole beginning of their work is what we call potato colors, colors... Colors, earth colors, potato colors, not at all dazzling, why? Not if they have the taste, but because they would not have approached the color. And, even if there is something more thrilling than that, literally, they still consider themselves worthy, they still consider themselves capable of tackling color, that is to say of really painting. They give them years, years to dare to approach color. They have to think that they are capable of going into color. It gives what everyone knows. But when you see, that's what they arrive at, you also have to think about this immense respect, this immense slowness to approach it. Something of color for a being is all the same something that goes as far as madness, unreason. So, very difficult, you have to defuse before you dare touch something like that. So, it's not at all that I'm particularly modest, but I say to myself, it's still a little shocking, it would be shocking, if there were philosophies like that. I'm going to go into philosophy, I'm going to do my philosophy, yes, I have my philosophy, all that is words, marbles, doing your philosophy. Philosophy is like color. Before entering into philosophy, it is necessary to be so careful. Before conquering the philosophical color and the philosophical color is the concept. Before knowing where to get to invent concepts, but it takes such work. And me, I believe that the history of philosophy is this slow modesty, you have to paint portraits for a long time. You have to do a long time, you have to paint a portrait. And then, it's as if a novel was there telling us, \u201cAh, I write novels, but you know, in order not to compromise my inspiration, I never read them. Others, I don't know. I've heard novels got there young, hold its startling proposals. Which is to say, I don't need to work. But as in a corner that is easy, it takes a long time to work before you can approach something. I believe that the history of philosophy, which is not simply preparatory, goes perfectly by itself. And the tears of the portrait, as it will allow us. First, something, that I think, it becomes mysterious. You would have to specify, you would have to force me to specify. I don't know, that's another small question, or I can continue like this. What happens when we do the history of philosophy? No, you got something else left on that. No, but the usefulness of the history of philosophy, the usefulness for you, we can see it clearly, you have just explained it, the usefulness of the history of philosophy for people, in general, since you don't know, since you don't say you don't want to talk about the specialization of philosophy, philosophy is also addressed to non-philosophies. We can understand, it's very simple. We can understand what philosophy is, that is to say to what extent? It's not at all, abstract things, philosophy, it's not even more, he doesn't see more than a painting, an agro-musical, it's absolutely not abstract. And that, we can understand, only by talking about the history of philosophy. On condition of conceiving it, it seems to me, if I may say so, on condition of conceiving it properly. Because what is it? There is one thing that seems certain to me, and that is that a philosopher is not someone who contemplates and he is not even someone who thinks. A philosopher is someone who creates. Simply, he creates a kind of thing, quite special, he creates concepts. Concepts don't exist completely, they don't walk around in the sky, they're not stars, we don't contemplate them, they have to be created, they have to be made. So there would be 1000 questions already, or we are already lost, because there are so many questions that arise. What's the point of recreating concepts? Because it would be a concept, but we let it go, for the moment, we let it go. I say, how an example, if I created a book on Plato? People, they know well that Plato creates there a concept which did not exist before him, and which generally translated by the idea. The idea with a capital t, with an image, and what does Plato call the idea? It is not at all the same thing as what another philosopher calls an idea. It's really a Platonition concept to the point that if someone has come up with the idea, in a similar sense, it looks like, well yes, he's a Platonition philosopher. I say to myself concretely what is it? You should never ask yourself, a fact of philosophy, if you don't have to do it, you really have to ask yourself, but what is it like if you have a dog? What had an idea? A dog, I can define it, what is an idea? For Plato, on there, I already do a hundred philosophies. I'll try to explain, like, that's it, well, even the need for a teacher, it seems to me to say, it doesn't seem to me the idea, it's something that wouldn't be anything else, that is to say, it would only be what it is. So there too, it seems abstract, I was saying it earlier, you mustn't be abstract, you have to do something that it is, it's abstract. But no, no, no. Taking a case which is not, which is not in Plato. A mother, a mother, a mother. She's a mother, but she's not just a mother. I mean, she is, for example, a wife, and then herself a mother's daughter. It's not a mother who is only a mother. It doesn't matter if such a thing exists or not. For example, is life marie, which Plato did not know, is a mother who is only a mother. And it doesn't matter if it exists or not. A mother who would not be anything else like a mother, who would not in turn be the daughter of our mother, that is what must then be called the idea of a mother. A thing that is just what it is. That's more or less what she means, Plato, we said to ourselves, only justice is just. Because only justice is nothing but just. I say finally, it's very her. So it becomes very simple. An idea of course, that's pretty close, but its point of departure is supposed to be such entities which of themselves than what they are. We call them idea. So he fears real concept, this concept did not exist before. The idea of the thing as pure, it is the purity that was finished the idea. But it remains abstract, we appear, why? For what ? If we ignore it, we indulge in reading Plato, and that's where everything becomes so concrete. He goes there in Paraza, he doesn't even like this concept of idea. paraza. He finds himself in a given situation. It's that whatever happens, in a very concrete situation, whatever happens, or whatever is given, there are suitors. That is to say there are people who say for this thing, it is less the better. Exemploi, it gives a definition of politics. And he says the political is to put a first definition, a definition of proof of departure, it is the passer-tor of men. He is the one who takes care of men. But on top of that, lots of people arrive and say, well, in that case, politics is less. It is less the passer-tor of men. It's seeing the trade there, can say that, the shepherd, who feeds all the doctor who treats, can say, he is less the true smuggler of men. In other words, there are you shores. So it starts to get a little more concrete. I say, a philosopher creates concepts. For example, the idea. The thing as pure. The reader does not immediately understand why, what it is about, that she needs to create such a concept. But if he also continues, reflects on his reading, he realizes that it is for the following reason. It's because there are all sorts of rivals who pretend to the thing, they are pretenders. And that the Platonist problem, it's going to be not at all, that what the idea is, all that, it's going to be reduced to the abstract. It's how to select the suitors, how to find out which of the suitors is the right one. And it is the idea, that is to say the thing in the making that will allow this selection, which will select the one that comes closest to it. So that allows us to move forward a little because I would say, any concept, for example, the concept of an idea, refers to a problem. The problem in this case is how to select suitors. If we do abstract philosophy, we don't even see the problem. Yes, if we reach the problem, the problem, why isn't it said by the philosopher? He is there in his work, we find, he is there, he is, he is staring, there is a meaning to it. Not if we can't do it all at once. The philosopher, he has already exposed the concepts that he is in the process of creating. It cannot additionally expose the problems to which it is concept. Or at least, we can find these problems only through the concepts that it bursts. And if you haven't found the problem, that very beautiful concept, everything is abstract. If you have found the problem, everything becomes concrete. And that's why I have platoons, there is constantly, it's a pretender, who it's riveau. So, I can add to it all of a sudden, it becomes all that, it becomes that. It takes everything, of course. Why is it in the Greek city? Why is it plato? Who brings up this problem. You see, the problem is how to select the contenders and the concept, and that's the philosophy. This is the problem and the concept. The concept is the idea, which is supposed to remodel the means of selecting suitors, no matter how one has it would be. But... Why is this problem, this concept, this Greek medium format? It actually starts with the Greeks, it's a typically Greek problem. It is a problem of the city and of the democratic city, even if Plato accepts think of a democratic character of the city, it is a problem of the democratic city. It is in a democratic city, for example, that a magistracy is the object of claim, there are pretenders, I claim such a function, in an imperial formation, as there were in the Greek era. In an imperial formation, there are air functions which are named by the grand empr\xf4tre. There is no such rivalry at all, the Athenian city, it is a rivalry of suitors. It's even already with the island, the suitors, in P\xe9naiglope, all that. Well, there is a whole middle, Greek problem. It is a civilization. The clash of rivals, constantly appears, that's why they before gymnastics. I mean, they before the one peak games. They advance, they are procedural, no one prose lasts like a Greek, but the procedure is the same thing, the trials. They are pretenders. You understand ? Philosophy, there will also be suitors. The struggle of Platos against the Sophists. This is where the house and the sophists are pretenders, something they are not entitled to. What will define the right or the non-right of a suitor? That's a problem. It's as fun as a novel. We know great novels, indeed, there are suitors who face each other in court. This is another thing. But in philosophy, I say, there are both at the same time. The creation of a concept and the creation of a concept is always done according to a problem. If we haven't found the problem, we don't understand the philosophy and she remained strept. I take a donation, for example, people generally don't see what a problem. It answers. They don't go to problems. Because the problems are, they are a little hidden, a little said, a little hidden, and the fact of the history of a philosophy is to restore these problems and suddenly, to discover a new summer of concepts. It says that the mav\xe8se history of a philosophy, it threads the concepts as if. It helps him to be as if they were not created and there is total ignorance, organ problems. I'll take one last quick example for... For a thought of the next stores.\",\"topics\":[\"philosophy\",\"history\",\"thinkers\",\"concepts\",\"difference\",\"concept\",\"politics\"],\"length\":14840,\"wordCount\":2668},{\"letter\":\"H\",\"title\":\"Histoire de la philosophie\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE -  H comme Histoire de la philosophie Part II.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Histoire2.mp3\",\"content\":\"So I'll take a second example that has nothing to do with diversity. Long after, there is a philosopher called Amnitz who makes and puts forward an extraordinary concept, an extraordinary concept, to which he will give the name of monad, who chooses a complicated technical word, monad and person. And we're made up of concepts that always have something a little crazy, this mother who wouldn't be like air, in the other case, the pure idea, all that, and there's something a little mad. And indeed the hand of the same, nor is there a designated sound, a subject, someone, you at least, insofar as it expresses the totality of the world, and that, expressing the totality of the world, it expresses clearly that a small region of the world, its territory, we have seen, we have already spoken of the territory, its territory or what the Amnitz calls its department. So a subjective unit that expresses the whole world, but he clearly expresses that a region than a department of the world, that's what he calls a mommade. So there too, it's a concept, he creates it, this concept does not exist before him. We say but why, why he created it, what... Very nice, it's going to be why do that, why say that, rather against luck. You have to find the problem, and it's not that he's hiding the problem, but if you don't look, you won't find it. And that's the charm of the Ir of philosophy, it's as much the charm and it's as amusing as the Ir, when he takes novels or looks at paintings, it's prodigious, that what do we notice, if we read it? Indeed, he did not create the concept of mandate for the pleasure, for his pleasure. But for other reasons it poses a problem which is what? Namely that everything in the world only exists bent. That's why I made the pound on him which was called the other fold. He experiences the world as a set of things that are eye-bent on each other. We can go back why does he live the world this way? What is happening? Just like for platons earlier, maybe the answer. At the time, did things bend? Does more than now? Well, we don't have time. What matters is this idea of a world that is folded and everything is a fold of a fold. We have the jabets to something completely unfolded. And matter is made of withdrawal into itself. And things of the mind, perceptions, feelings are bent in the soul. It is precisely because the perceptions, the feelings, the ideas, are folded in a soul that this concept of a soul which expresses the whole world is built there. That is to say in which the whole world lies bent. So, pressure, we mean, what is a bad philosopher? What is a great philosopher? A bad philosopher is someone who does not invent a concept. Who uses says ready-made. Opinions are wrong. He does not do philosophy. He says, here is what I take. Well, we still know a lot of them now, but he had them all the time. Opinions, good. He does not invent a concept. And it does pose the real fate of the good problem. It poses no problem. So, writing the history of a philosopher is this long apprenticeship, where one learns. Or one is really an apprentice in this double field. The constitution of problems, the creation of concepts. There is no, if you will, what does he do? What is he doing there? Thought can be silly logs etc. People are talking. But we know I resent what the problem is themselves. Not only does it create no concept. They put opinions, but in addition we know I want what problem he is talking about. I mean, we know the questions, but if I say does God exist? It's not a problem, does God exist? I don't know of them problems. Yes, he is the problem. Why do I remember this question? What is the problem behind this? People want to ask the question. Ah, do I believe in God? Don't I believe in God? But does anyone care? Who believes in God? Who believes in God? What about these... Is that why they say that? That is to say what problem it answers. And what concept are they going to manufacture? What concept of God are they going to fabricate? If you don't have a concept or a problem, you're solving stupidity, that is to say, you're not doing philosophy. But he thought how fun philosophy is. The history of philosophy, since it's... It's a sincere part of the history of philosophy. Find... It's not so difficult what you have to do when you find yourself in front of a big picture, in front of a musical confession. Precisely, we return to Gauguin and Van Gogh, since you evoked their tremblings of fear before approaching the color. What happened? When did you move from the history of philosophy and philosophy to your own philosophy? This is it. Without doubt, the history of philosophy... Had given me my life at the price of things. That is to say, I felt more capable of approaching what is color in philosophy, that is to say. But why does this arise? I mean why does philosophy not stop? Why doesn't he stop? For example, why is there still philosophy today? There is not so a place to always create concepts. So this notion of creation of the concept, it is the publicity which is part of it. He creates concepts, with computers, all that. There is a whole language that has been stolen from philosophy. So it creates a question? Communication, you have to be creative, you have to create concepts. But opposite what they call concept, do they call creating a psychological thing? There is no need to insist. It remains the land of philosophy. It is still relevant today. I've never been touched by people who say the death of philosophy, of the past of philosophy, of philosophies that say such complicated things. But, it never kept, never touched because I tell myself well, what does all this mean? As long as there is a need to create concepts, there will be philosophy, since that is what defines. And that the concepts do not expect us everything. They have to be created. So, and they are feared function of problem. The problems will evolve. So there is any place. So, of course, you can be a plateodic, you can be a Dixian, even today, in 1989, you can do all that. We can be aware. What does it mean? It means that we consider that some, by all in doubt, that some problems posed by Plato, remain valid, have undergone certain transformations. Because we have, we are plateodics. And we still use plateodic concepts. If we pose problems of a completely different nature, in my opinion, there is no case where there is not among the great philosophers, one or more great philosophers, who is something to tell us about the problems transformed today. But to do philosophy is to create new concepts based on the problems that arise today. So the last aspect of this question, it would obviously be good, what is the evolution of problems? What does it insure? So, I would always say to myself historical, social forces, yes, okay. But there is something more professional. It's very mysterious and then we wouldn't have time. But I very much believe in a kind of becoming of thought. Evolution of thought, which means that we not only don't pose the same problems, but we don't pose them in the same way. A problem can be posed in several successive ways and there is an urgent call, a great grander, which calls on the need always to create, to recreate new concepts. There is a history of thought which would be bread, which would be bread to sociological influence or to influence. There is everything to become of thought, which is always very mysterious, which we would have to be able to define, which means that perhaps today we don't think in the same way as... 100 years ago , we don't think today, well, I hear processes of thoughts and elipses of thoughts and thought, it has its history. There is a history of pure thought. So doing philosophy for me is exactly that. It has only ever had one function, in my opinion, philosophy. She had that she needs to be thought since she has her function. 4, 1. It's still. She is towing a mile. Yes, you meant that... Yes, how is a problem across the pond? It must... It's already not... That is to say that the thought has come. And no, that... Ivanka is there with L\xe9do, a meeting. I know that from a newer olhar orang it is that the mind is mistaken, avoid that the mind is mistaken, as one avoids laughter. And then there is very the angliation and in the 18th century begins to put a different problem. It might look the same and in fact it is not the same at all. It is no longer to denounce the laughter to denounce the isles-lusions. The idea that the mind falls and even surrounds and illusion, much more than it produces itself. Not only does it fall into errors, but it produces islands-lusions. It's the whole 18th century movement, 18th century philosophers, denunciation, superstition, etc. But it could look a little like the 17th century. And in fact the problem that begins to set entirely new. So we can say there too, there are social reasons, etc. But there is also a story of the secret of thought which would be fascinating to do. The question is more how to avoid falling into laughter, but how to manage to dissipate the islands-lusions with which the mind surrounds itself. And then in the 18th century. I'm going on purpose to say things so together, so rudimentary in the 18th century. What is happening? As if it slipped and even it did not completely, but it is the more and more. How to avoid, what, the illusion, no. It is more than the mind. But let men, as spiritual creatures, keep talking nonsense. It's more the same thing as the illusion, it's not falling into an illusion, it's how to ward off stupidity. So it's not going to be very clear. I am at the border of philosophy. When the flow-bet, it was at the border of philosophy. The problem of stupidity, beauty of the air, the problem of stupidity is more the same thing as illusion, etc. So we can say there too, it is linked to social developments. For example, the evolution of the bourgeoisie in the 18th century which made the problem of stupidity an urgent problem. Fine, but there is something deeper in these developments, in this kind of history of the problems that thought faces. And each time a problem is posed, there are new concepts that appear. So that if we understand philosophy in this way, creation of concepts, constitution of problem, the problems being more or less hidden, therefore it is necessary to rediscover them, all that. One impresses that philosophy has strictly, but nothing to do with the true the false. It has nothing to do with the real the fake, it's not looking for the truth. Philosophy, it is not nothing to say, each in the truth. If it's about creating concepts, what does that mean? A concept, it is... and constituting a problem is not a matter of truth or falsification, it is a matter of meaning. A problem, well, it has to have a meaning. There are problems that don't make sense. There are issues that make sense. Doing philosophy is constituting problems that have meaning and creating concepts that move us forward in understanding and solving the problem. We are going to come back to two questions that are more specific to you. Oh, it seems to me that I had... Yes. When you redid the history of philosophy with the A\xefbnitz last year, was it the same way as you had done it 20 years ago? That is to say before producing your own philosophy? Was it the same way? No, probably not. Probably not, because before, I really used philosophy and the history of philosophy as a way of... Yes, like this kind of essential learning where I only looked for other people's concepts, that is, great philosophers and what problem they answered. It says what there, what I did on the Aibnitz, I... There's nothing vanity in what I'm saying. I have put the 20th century problems which may be the focus of the problem of A\xefbnitz once said that I am convinced of the topicality of philosophers. If you want, a great philosopher, to do like him, what does it matter? To do like him is not necessarily to be a disciple of him. To do like him is to prolong his task, to create concepts in relation to those who created him, to submit problems in relation and in evolution with those who created him. So I think that by doing the A\xefbnitz, I was more on that path, wait for it, in my first philosophy books, I was at the pre-cut stage there, yes. And you declared there a statement of Spinoza and we can also apply it to Nietzsche, that he linked you to the somewhat hidden and somewhat modest part of the history of philosophy. What did that mean? In that perhaps... we would have the opportunity to come back to it for me. And I believe that we will have the opportunity to come back to it. For me, that means this hidden part, it's people who... they're thinkers who rejected all transcendence. Who rejected all transcendence, it will have to be defined as we will have the opportunity, perhaps, to speak again of transcendence. These are authors who reject all universals, that is to say the idea of concept, there is a universal value, and any transcendence, that is to say any authority that goes beyond the earth and the men. But to come back to what was before, it's the authors of the immannonce. You, you have your books on Nietzsche or Spinoza, a date, that is to say that you are known for your books on Spinoza or on Nietzsche. And yet, one cannot say that you are Nietzsche, nor Spinoza, as one can say, of a platonition or an etian, that which you went through all that, even when it served you as an apprentice, and you I was already from the oisien. We cannot say that you are Spinoza. There, you make me a very great compliment, that is to say if it is true, I am... But you, how did you feel? I always wished, I think indeed that well, had me, I could fail, but I think that I tried to pose problems for my account and to create concepts for my account. Almost to the limit, I would dream of a quantification of philosophy. That means, each philosopher would be assigned a number of magic numbers, according to the number of concepts that he actually created. Will return problems etc. It would have magic numbers, well, cases, shut up, the limit, but that would be interesting. So, obviously, I dare not go there. Me, I might have a very small magic number to know how to create some concepts according to problems. Simply, I said to myself, my boss is that whatever kind of concepts I tried to create, I can tell what problem it answered for me. And to refine? Otherwise, it would be gossip. That's it, but yes, I'm here with a last question, but I have to know what it is absolutely. Oh yes. She is a bit provocative. When you were in 68, in the 68s, or even before, when everyone was explaining Marx, everyone, there was Reich. There was no provocation on your part to turn towards Nid, which was really suspicious of fascism in those years, and to talk about Spinoza and the body, when everyone would have been building their ears with Reich. So history of philosophy, it didn't work as a little provocation too. We're going to do it again because we're at home. Wasn't there a little provocation all the same? No, but it's very linked, did we just say? It's almost the same question. Because, I was looking for even if we were looking for it with Fedix, it was the spirit of a truly immanent dimension of the unconscious. For example, all of psychoanalysis is full of transcendent elements, the law, the father, the mother, or that, you said that there is a manance site that would make it possible to define the unconscious. That, then, is the domain, maybe Spinoza could go further than nobody had been, maybe Nietzsche could also go further than nobody had been. It seems to me not so much provocation, it was that Spinoza and Nietzsche, forming philosophy, perhaps the greatest, I mean, liberation of thought, almost in the sense an explosive. Yes, and perhaps the concepts, the most unusual concepts, because their problems are problems that were a bit modis problems. Then we are not posed, at the time of Spinoza, in any case, certainly, but even at the time of Nietzsche. The problems that we would not have posed too much are what are called rough problems of gold. Alright, so we can move on,\",\"topics\":[\"philosophy\",\"history\",\"thinkers\",\"concepts\",\"becoming\",\"transcendence\",\"body\",\"concept\"],\"length\":16428,\"wordCount\":2970},{\"letter\":\"I\",\"title\":\"Id\xe9e\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE -  I comme Ide\u0301e.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Idee.mp3\",\"content\":\"So are we in case? No, we're at... Ah wall yes! So he, it's like... he as an idea. So it's more the idea of the tenition that we come from bouquets, that you come from bouquets. It is first of all that more than drawing up an inventory of theories, you have always been passionate about the ideas of philosophers, as you have just shown, nothing soft. For the ideas of thinkers in the cinema, that is to say the directors on stage, for the ideas of artists in painting. Always to explanations and comments you preferred the idea. Yours is that of others. Why for you does the idea preside over everything? There it is, it's true, the idea in the sense of care, the employment that is no longer... it's no longer a question of Platos, the idea in the sense of care, all the creative activities. Very is to have an idea. More it is very difficult to have an idea, people who live and who are not at all contemptible for that, they live their whole life without having an idea. Before an idea, it's around domains. There are no areas where there is no need to have ideas. But it's rare, it's still a party to have an idea. It doesn't happen every day. I have a shepherd and he has no less ideas than a philosopher. It's just not the same kind of idea. We would have to ask like that, if we reflect on the different activities of man, under what force does the idea represent in such and such a case. In philosophy, at least, we have just seen. The idea in philosophy is presented in the form of a concept and there is creation of the concept. There is no overdraft of concept. There are as many creations in a philosophy as in a painting, as in a musical work. But the others, the others, they have ideas, they just hit what is called a manteur en scene. It's important, there are a lot of performers out there who have never had a clue. But ideas are very obsessive. It's like things that go, that come, and then that take various forms, if they are worth it, they are condescending to say things very like that. Near that I think of a height of cinema like minelle Lille. We can say, but in all his work there is not in all that you cannot turn around, but think that if the easy ones, here is someone who wonders, it seems to me, what is is that right? People dream. They dream. We talked a lot about that, it's platitude, they dream. People dream, certainly. But Minelle asks him a very strange question, which has not been to him to my knowledge. What the hell got caught up in someone's dream? And it goes from the comic, to the tragic, to the bomminable? What does it mean, for example, to be caught up in a young girl's dream? Well, they can come out of it on TV, get caught up in someone's dream, get caught up in it's someone's dream. Maybe it's the rheur at the \xe9tapure. Sometimes, minelle Lille, then, in a dream, it will mean being caught in the nightmare of war. And that gives the admirable, the chivaliers of the poquette, where he does not consider war as war. It would not be minelle Lille, he considers the war as a great nightmare. What's that gonna say, caught in a nightmare? What's it going to mean to be caught in the girl's dream? And that makes musicals. And that makes faples musicals, where it's fresh by a stere, I think, where I read that she says, I don't know, and escapes, where we grease you, where we black area, I don't know what, so that's it, he caught in someone's dream, it's true. It's true, that's an idea. In short, and yet, it's not a concept, but she knows it, if he didn't think of a concept, he would be doing philosophy, he's making films. The reminders that it is almost necessary to distinguish three kinds of hours, three dimensions, three things, so strongly that it mixes everything. There is, we should talk about one, and that, I think there is still it is my future work, there that I explain. That's what I would really like to do. Now, I'm going to take care of that, he was trying to be clear, there, there are concepts. Concepts which are really ahead of philosophy, and then there are what we might call percepts. Who has that, it's the domain of art, the percepts. Percepts, so what are percepts? I believe that an artist is someone who creates percepts. So why used in my bizarre, percepts, everything rather perception, precisely, is that percepts are not perceptions. You would say to put it, what does a man of letters, a writer, a novelist want, there. I believe that he wants to succeed in constructing sets of perception, of sensation, which occurs to those who experience them. Exceeding a percept. A percept is a set of percepts and sensations that occur to those who experience them. I take examples. There are stage rate pages which describes, good, which describes as a painter, there is a barely book, which describes or check-off. From the number to handle, which describes the heat in the stadium. So it's all a complex sense to sure. We pass, there are certain visual and auditory senses, there is almost a stative, something in the process of the mouth, I find that good. So, tell me, there is a work school. Try to give this complex meaning to sure, radical independence, not from whoever was proving them. Tolstoy also describes atmospheres. Must be clear in the large pages of Faults-Tlaire, if you could give up the very large ones. They get to that. There will be some who almost said it and whom I really like, I don't think very well known in France, America, it's Thomas Wolf. Thomas Wolf, he says in his news, he says here, someone is going out in the morning. And he smells of fresh air. A smell comes to him, from a door-cow of pagrillet, but there is a complex meaning to sure, to nuts at the step in the sky, there is a complex meaning to sure. What happens when he dies, the one who proves them, or when he does something else? What becomes of it? That's good, it seems to me a bit like the question of art. Art gives an answer to that. To give a duration or an eternity, this complex meaning to sure, which most grasped, as being experienced by someone, or at the very least which is going to be grasped, as being experienced by a character in a novel, that is, say by a fictional character. This is what generates fiction. And what to do to graze? I think he doesn't just do that, but grazes gives consistency to perceptions. It tore perceptions from percepts. There is a phrase of the season that touches me more than anything. He says impressionism? Yes, a shepherd doesn't do anything else. He will do a lot to me, we can already say that the Impressionists, he completely distorts perception. We can say that we infiltrate the offices to the letter. In a way, it will work. It is a habit of thinking which is new. It's people who aren't used to thinking like that. It will force. An impercept of that hurts, in a way, it hurts the nerves. We can say that the impressionists, they rave about the percept. But now these donkeys, there is a word about these donkeys, it opens so beautifully, it says something that lasting impressionism provides. It does not yet have the reason for steps that are independences. If it slips, it doesn't make it lasting and only him, new methods are needed to take on lasting impressionism. It does not simply mean that the painting is more conserved. It means that the percept acquires an even greater autonomy. New techniques will be needed and reports will be needed. And then there would be a third thing, I believe very much, and most of all, it's what should be called the affects. So of course, there is no piercing without affects, affects them, it's not all the same, I was trying to define the percept as a set of perception and sensation of good independent of the one who proves them. For me, affects and becomings are becomings which overflow the one who passes through them, which exceeds the forces of the one who passes through them. It's an affect. I took over what music would not be the great creator of affects. Wouldn't that lead us into powers that hold us back that which makes us good? It's possible, but all I'm saying is that the three sounds are related anyway. If you take a philosophical concept, it's more a matter of accents. If you take a philosophical concept, it's true that a concept makes things see. He shows things. In this way, the philosophies are all the same on the seeing side, but still of those who love me, which will show us. He was one of the more showy philosophies than they are. Un \xedd, he shows things. And also, it's spears of fantastic affects. So at that point, you really have to talk. It turns out all on the mind. There is a music of these philosophies. And with this moment, we saw the music say it makes you see very strange things. Our would even sometimes be colors, it shows colors that exist by ordelle, ordelle music. And the percepts too, all of that is very much linked. And I will dream of a kind of circulation, the ades in others, of philosophical concepts, of pictorial perceptions, of musical affects. And it's no wonder there are reasons. If an addiction, it's works of... They're works of completely different genres, but they don't know how to penetrate each other. So, these ideas of painters, artists and philosophers, which are the opposite of having ideas, but which are an idea of perception, an idea of affection, an idea of reason. Why you ? Finally, in life, you can see a movie, or read a book, where there is no idea. And you, it hurts you to a point. It does not interest you. I find it uninteresting. There's absolutely no point in you watching something that can be fun, or reading something that can be entertaining, if there isn't that idea. If there is no idea. In the sense that I come to define an idea, I find it hard to see that this would be possible. If you showed me a painting where there is no percept, where there is a cow which is represented, which is more on the seeming arm, but where there is no cow percept, where she does not is not raised to the state of perception. If you want to hear music where there is no affect, ultimately, I even see because it can mean. If you want to drag me into a film, yes, it's if you want to tell yourself an idiotic philosophy book, I don't see what pleasure, if not bad blood pleasure, one can have there. But it wasn't a silly philosophy book, it could be a humorous book. A humorous book, down on the, and the dish says, maybe. I don't know, I was spending everything on the humorous pelie, I had no one to make anyone more, that in any case, so I'm very sensitive to humor, I find it very vendroule, I like less comics on TV, yes. It is indeed he, that there is certainly an idea. It's an idea, yes. Indeed, even in the Thumbnaise, obviously the great American birlesses, they have ideas. And ideas. And you, that is to say, you arrive at your silk to finish with a more personal question, at your table without any idea of what you are going to do, that is to say, you do not have the idea, how does it go? No, if I don't have the idea that I'm not going to have at your table, what happens to me is that the idea isn't developed, it's that the idea escapes me, it's that the idea is there, it's the holes, and all that, that, I have experienced the horror of all that. Yes, it's not all that, yes. Since ideas do not exist, everything is done, to make them, at a call, however, there are terrible times, that is to say there are times when literally, we hope and I won't be able, yes. Yes, that, yes. It's the expression, the idea that makes it too lacking, is it both? A possible to distinguish that. Do I have the idea that I can't express it?

Avoiding sad patients and living with joy to be at our most powerful. So you have to do resignation, bad conscience, guilt, all the sad affects that exploit near judge and psychoanalyst. So we can see exactly what could please you in all of this. So first I would like you to distinguish joy from sadness and for this spinosat and necessarily for you. Is the distinction of this spinosat first totally latian? Did you find anything the day you read this? Yes, because these are the texts then most extraordinarily loaded with affects, loaded with affects in this spinosat. But that comes down to saying, it brings me together, that plies a lot, but that comes down to saying, joy is everything that consists in filling a power. You experience joy when he fills you up, when he gives you power. So what is it ? We will come back to our examples. I conquer, however little it may be a piece of color, I draw a little into the color. Against the joy that it can be joy. That is to fulfill a power, to effect a power. I have a power fill. So it is the minus power that is equivocal. On the contrary, what is sadness? It is when I am separated from a power that, rightly or wrongly, or rightly or wrongly, I believed myself capable of. I can do that. But the circumstances either, it was not allowed, or it was not possible. So there is sadness. One would have to say that all sadness is the effect of a power over me. It's a nice to talk about. It was a nice to talk. We were at the report, finally, to the opposition joy sadness. Yes, I say with, you are something of his power. It's always good. That's what the fidots say. Well, there are problems there. We need clarification. There is no evil power. No bad power. What is bad is not. What is bad or good, what is bad, should be said is the lowest seed of potency. And the lowest seed of power is power. I mean the wickedness of secoires is prevented. Someone to do what can. The wickedness of secoirs, it is a sin, one to cause his power to fail. So that there is no evil power, there are evil powers. And maybe all power is evil by matue, not necessarily, maybe it's too easy to say that. But it is indeed the idea of the confusion of powers and power. It is ruinous because power always separates people who are submissive from those who pave the way. It is good that it is from there that by this binozane, she makes use of the sadness and the links to the loans, to the ties, to the judges, to the judges. It's superpetually people, it's not who it's not. Their subject of what they can, which prohibits powerful effectuations. You were doing a lujon earlier, it's very curious, you were doing a lujon. Donnich's reputation for anti-Sebitism. This is clear, because this is a very important question. There are texts of illusions, very disturbing, if we actually read them, if we don't read them as we suggested earlier to read the philosophers, if we read them a little too quickly. And it is very curious that all the texts, where they attack the Jewish peoples, what do they reproach the Jewish peoples for illusions? What are they doing that we said, or is it a lujon, it's very interesting, because they reproach the Jewish peoples. They accuse him today of very precise conditions of having invented a character who did not exist before him and who is the character of the priest. To my knowledge, there are never less texts of illusions, which one serves in the Jews, on the mandu, of an attack. It is always an attack on the Jewish peoples who invented the priest. Well, to believe that according to him in the other social formations, there can be sorcerers, scribes, it is not the same thing as the priest. They made this astonishing adventure and Nietzsche, at the same time as he has a great philosophical force, Nietzsche did not admire what hates. He says, it's an unbelievable adventure to have invented the priest. It is something prodigious. And then, it is made the link straight from the Jews to the Christians. Calling himself, it's not the same type of priest. But the Christians, then, conceive of another type of priest and will continue in the same way the character of the priestess. That is to say how concrete philosophy is. I mean, I would say Nietzsche, and to my knowledge, the first philosopher to invent creating the concept of a priest. And starting from there to have posed a fundamental problem, in what consists the capacity sits as much. What is the difference between the power to sit as much with the power to believe in y'a, with the power, etc.? This is a question that is still quite topical, for example. Foucault perhaps so much before his edge, with fully recovered with his own means, there, there would be to resume our whole beginning on what does it make to continue, to prolong philosophy, what does it do ? In fact, it is that Foucault also proposes post-storal power, a new concept which even deviates from that of Nietzsche, but which interlocks with that of Nietzsche. This is where there is a history of thought. And what is it in him priest? And in what is there sadness? It is because, according to Nietzsche, in any case, the priest is defined by this. It is because he advances the idea that men are in a state of infinite debt. That they have an infinite debt. Before, there were many stories of debt. We know it, but Nietzsche preceded all ethnologists. That, ethnologists would have a lot of interest in reading Nietzsche. Because they have, when ethnologists discovered long after Nietzsche, that in so-called primitive societies, there were exchanges of debt. And that, perpetually, it worked not so much by barter, as we believed, but that it worked by piece of debt. A tribute that has a date next to the tribute name, etc., etc., yes, but it was finished debt blocks. We received and then we returned. The difference with barter is that there was time. This is the reality of time. It's a different rendering. It's huge. Then it remb\xe8\xe8re, the date is first in relation to the exchange. These are all philosophical issues. The changes, the date, the date which is first in relation to the exchange, it is a great philosophical concept. I say philosophical, because Nietzsche said he was good at having ethnologists. But as long as the debts, or decrees trust me, man can free himself from them, when the Jewish priest, a vote the idea, by virtue of an alliance of an infidel debt, of the Jewish people vis-\xe0-vis live by his God, when the criteria take it up in another form, the idea of the infidi debt, the original epic, it is a character seen as a very curious priest, of which it is up to philosophy to make the concept and intends that '\xe9, I'm not saying that philosophy is necessarily atta\xef, but within the framework of an author like spinosa, who had already sketched out an analysis of the priest, of the Jewish priest, in particular in the line from heology to politics, which we see, it happens that philosophical concepts are real characters, that's why philosophy is so concrete. Doing the concept of the priest is like another type of artist, fresh the painting of the priest, the portrait of the priest, the concept of the priest led by spinosa and then by niche. And finally by Foucault, I say that it formed an exciting line. Me, for example, I would also like to eat lapdans, see a little, what this power goes through, they say it works more, you have to see what it has taken over. For that, what I was saying, in effect, the analysis instrument is a new avatar of past toral power. Now, in a definite way, it's not the same thing as the tie rods, the priests, you mustn't confuse everything, but they have, at least, to hold their power from the sad passions they inspire in men. Type, repent in the name of infinite debt, you are obligated to infinite debt, etc. That's where they have power. It is in that power is always an obstacle put to the effectuation of powers. While I would say all power the sad ones. Even if those who have power over them enjoy a lot of voice, it is a sad joy. There are sad joys, it is a sad joy. On the other hand, joy is the effectuation of powers. Again, I don't know, I don't know power, but I don't know power. The small bottom is a power. He must rejoice in his soul, but it is not to beat the houses that he rejoices. It is to be, it is to rejoice in being what one is. That is to say, to have arrived there-honor. So it's not self-joy. It is not a joy, it is not being satisfied with oneself. Not at all, it is not the pleasure of being satisfied with oneself. It is the pleasure of conquest, as you are told. But the conquest, what happened, is to see people again. Conquest is present, not being conquered by color. Yes, that is a conquest. There is joy. Even if it turns out badly, because in these stories of power, when you conquer a power, when you conquer something in a power, it runs the risk of being too powerful for the person himself. So here we go. 8 y. So, a small follow-up question. You, that there is the chance of copings with infinite debt. When it's done that you complain from morning to night and you have a great defender of the complaint and the \xe9ligie? It's a personal question. The eligia, yes, I have always found, first the eligia, it is one of the two sources of poetry. Finally, it is one of the main sources of poetry. This is the big complaint. So, there is a lot, there would be a whole story of the \xe9ligie affair. I don't know if it was made, but it's very interesting, because there is the complaint of the prophet. Prophetism is quite paradable. The prophet is the one who complains, who says, but why did God choose me there? What I did for her chosen by God? In sense, she contracted to the priest. So he complains, he complains, about what is happening to him. Meaning, it's too big for me. That's the complaint. What is happening to me is too big for me. So if we accept that the complaint, it doesn't always show, it's not high, there was, there was, there was that I still have pain only one. That's it too. But the one who complains, which means it, the old lady who complains about cerimatism, she means, in fact, that she can forgive herself a kind of it that is too big for me to bear. It's too big for me. If we look at history, it's very interesting, wrong and legitimate, indeed, the elegit first, it's the deaf of poetry, there, it's only Latin poetry. And the poets of the complexion, the great poets of the complexion. I knew him in, I read a lot in the past, Catule, Tibers, all that, they are prodigious poets. What is elegit? Me, I think it's the expression of someone who is temporarily out of step, who no longer has any social status. For that, it is interesting. A good old soplan, yes, okay. A guy on the galleys, this full. It's not sadness at all. It's a very long thing, it's their vindication, the board that is amazing. And there is worship in the board. It's like a prayer, the plank. The complaints of popular, you have to put all the complexion. I said it to the plank of the prophet. The plate, the of a subject you know well, since you worked on it wrongly, the plate of the hypochondriac. The hypochondriac is someone who complains, and the intensity of the complaints, the hypochondriac are beautiful. Why am I a liver? Why am I a vate? 'Cause it hurts me, that's why am I? Why am I disorganized? Why is that? Why am I... Finally, the board is sublime. The popular board, completes it. The complete of the sasra, the complete which is sung by the people. I say, it's the socially excluded who are in trouble. There is a Chinese specialist. Not big Chinese, I believe, whose name is Tecaille, who has done tutes on Chinese elegy. And it shows that, in my memory, it shows that Chinese elegy is anime before everything else. The one who no longer has a social status, that is to say, the slave to Franche. Just a slave. He still has such an unhappy status. He can be very unhappy, he can be beaten all you want. He still has a social status. When he is a Franche, there are times when there is no social status for the Franche slave. He is beyond everything. It must be a bit like that, the liberation of blacks in America with the police on slavery. When he abolished slavery, there was no statute yet. He finds himself excluded. If we interpret stupidly, they sent well, they come back. They have broken status, they are excluded from any community. So, at that time, is the big plant. Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya. But it's not the pain they have. It's a kind of luck. It is a political source. Me, I wouldn't have been a philosopher, or I would have been a woman. I wanted to be a mourner. The mourner, it's true. The plant rises. It's an art. And then, it didn't matter a bit. That means, you don't charge a plan. I don't touch myself. It's a bit like overly polite people. And me, too polite people, and I would like to be more and more polite, it's not touching me. I don't touch myself. So it's a kind of... The plant is the same thing. Don't complain, I'll take care of it. But by changing it yourself, you transform the plant. Again, this is what happens to me and too big for me. That's the plant. So, me, I mean every morning. What happens to me and too big for me is joy. In a way, it's the joy at the cut, but that we are careful to hide. There are people who don't really like people to be happy. It must therefore be hidden in a kind of flat. But this plant is not only joy, because it is a time a foline that is study in my facts. Perform a power, well maybe she took. Am I not going to leave my skin there? As soon as we perform a power, I even talk about things too. It's a bit simple that a shepherd who approaches color. Won't he leave his skin there? But literally, after all, I don't believe it's done in literature, to say that the way Van Gogh went into color has more to do with his madness than with stories of psychoanalysis, and that's relationships with color that were also tapped, in any case. Something is about to break me. It's too big for me. It's too big for me. In misfortune or in happiness, I really don't have the time.\",\"topics\":[\"joy\",\"affects\",\"Spinoza\",\"ethics\",\"difference\",\"affect\",\"concept\",\"philosophy\"],\"length\":14534,\"wordCount\":2672},{\"letter\":\"K\",\"title\":\"Kant\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE - K comme Kant.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Kant.mp3\",\"content\":\"So what about those cantes of all the egg girls that you've done a study, when one seems farther from your own thought, yet you say that all the authors that you'll study have something in common. First, is there something in common between this cant and this pinoza? Which is not obvious. I prefer if jose the first part of the question. That is to say, why are you occupied with the cant of a cold one? There is nothing in common between cant and this pinoza. There is nothing in common between pinoza and pinoza. There is nothing in common between pinoza and pinoza. But it is not the same conception of philosophy. Why am I still fascinated by Kant? For reason, there is so much turning Kant. For a reason, it's a reason where he has a story-pouch until the end of something that has not been pushed into philosophy until then. Namely, it is rich from the courts. He is wealthy from the courts, he no doubt may have under French reflection. And until now, we always talk about concepts that the I tried to talk about concepts as characters. Before Kant, there is in the 18th century, after it is from Kant, there is a type of new philosopher who presents himself as the investigator. Investigation. Survey of human understanding. Investigate this. Investigate this. Philosophy has a bit like an investigator. Before again. Still in the 17th century, for example, the Eme Nitz is undoubtedly the last exhibitor of this trend. He sees himself as a lawyer. He defends a cause. And the most beautiful century in Eme Nitz claims to be the advocate of God. It is necessary to believe that God has things to reproach him at the time. And he writes to Mervilleuse at Puscus, the cause of God, which does not mean that God is a cause in the sense of God. The legal cause of God, the cause of God defended, etc. So it's like an intermingling of characters, the lawyer. The investigator is when a court arrives. A court of reason. Things are judged according to a court of reason. And the lot faculties of understanding, imagination, knowledge, morality, are measured according to a court of reason. Who makes use of a certain method, which is a prodigious method and which will call us the critical method. And which is the actual cant method. So this whole aspect is almost a little horror. Which is to say such a fascinated horror, because it's so awesome. If I go back to the question, among the concepts that when we are ahead, there is that of the court of reason, which is quite similar to the critical method. But anyway, I rather dream of... It's a court of judgment, it's the system of judgment. It's just that the judgment system needs God more. A system of judgment based on reason, and no longer on God. Me, all the authors who touch me, we have not limited this problem, but we can put it now, it will prevent us from coming back, it will make us... It will perhaps avoid us, we can always ask ourselves, because there is a mystery. But why is someone, someone in particular, you or me, we are linked or we recognize ourselves in one type of problem, and not in another. What's the end of someone with some kind of problem? These are not the mysteries of thought, and the greatest. We are dedicated to one of the problems, we don't push the import of which problem, that also goes for scholars, in science. Someone's end for such and such a problem, but such and such another problem, and he didn't enter into it. And a philosophy is a set of problems, generally, there is a specific consistency, which does not have to cover all the problems, god be hearing. Well, I feel a little connected to the problem, which proposes to look for means to put an end to the system of the judge. And to put something else in their place. So that, in the big names of that, that's one of the facts, that's another tradition, there, you were right to say that, that arises. I see this pilonza, I see Nietzsche, I see Lawrence literature, and in fact, I look to make it the newest and greatest, Arton. To finish, ecologically, of God, that means something, it's not a crazy word. It is really to be taken literally to put an end to the judgment system. So all that, these are things that would have meant that I wouldn't have had so much, only there you go, on that, it's as always, when we say that we must always look under the concepts for the problems. And on top of that, there are astonishing problems of Kant, which are marvels, and which are marvels. First, he is the first to have made an astonishing reversal of concept. There too, that's why it makes me slash so introspectively, when people are even at the baccalaureate level, when young people are taught a philosophy of abstraction without trying, even maybe it's not possible to make them participate in problems, which are fantastic problems, all the same, otherwise interesting. I do not know what. I can say up to Kant, for example. Time derived from motion. He was second to the movement. It was considered a number of movement, a measure of movement. What does Kant do? He can't bring how he does it? A concept is created. So, we don't know all that, including everything I'm saying, there's only that. We do not know to advance in what will come to create a concept. It reverses subordination with it, it is movement that depends on time. And suddenly, time changes its nature. It has to be circular, when time is subordinated to movement, for reasons that would be too long, finally, the great movement is periodic movement, it is the movement of rotation of the stars, it is the periodic motion of the stars. So the motion is circular. On the contrary, when time frees itself from movement, and it is movement that depends on time, then time becomes a straight line. And I always think of the word borg\xe8s, that one can choose it with Kant, when one is going to say of it a labyrinth more terrible than any circular labyrinth, a labyrinth in a straight line. That's a marvel, but it's Kant. It is he who frees up time to review. And then, try to pay tribute, there, which measures the role of each faculty according to such a goal. This is what happens at the end of his life, since he is one of the few, to have written very, very, very old to a book, where he renewed everything. Criticism of judgment. He arrives at the idea that it is necessary that the faculties help relate to disorder with each other. Which sister is grateful to you, reads all that, but which is a battle of the faculties which is out of proportion. He is no longer justice of a tribunal. This will be his theory of the sublime, his conception of the sublime, where the faculties enter into discordances, into discordant harmonies. So, that called me to finish. These discordant chords, this abira, which is more than a straight line, are reversals of the relationship. I can say, the whole Bendaire philosophy stemmed from that, that it was more time that depended on movement, but that movement depended on time. It's fantastic concept creations and the whole conception of the sublime, with the discordant agreements between the faculties, it touched me at the same time. So, what to say, it was obvious, he was a very, very great philosopher. And there is a whole base in him, which excites me, and what is built on it, even to say, there is, even to say, but that's fine. It is a judgment system that I would like to end with. But I am not. And the life of Kant. Oh, Kant's life. He did not see the denuitations without a sitting. That wasn't planned, huh? THANKS. 10 y. So, there was another aspect that could also have been pleasing in Kant. This is the aspect that wins Thomas de Kuinces, that is to say this fantastic life regulated by habits, a short walk, the life of a philosopher, such as one can imagine in a vision of criminal, finally, something very special, and which we think of when we think of you. That is to say, something fairly settled. The habit is huge. Me, I think that... Yes, I'm getting dressed as you mean, because Kuinces's text is enthusiasm, and me, is enthusiasm too, it's a ch\xe9deu, okay. And... It's true that it belongs to all philosophers. So they don't have the same habits, but whether they're creatures of habit, so it seems to say that they don't know and it's... It's forcex, they're creatures of habit. Because the spinosa, I don't have the impression that the spinosa, he also had a lot... Unexpectedly, he had a city with his lenses, police and his lenses, the supposed for him is the West Indies, he received visits like that, good. But you are neither his life in the position of the roads? It's not a glass that seems very agitated, except by the political remonstrances of the time, but when also, with political remonstrances in time, then, and then, all that is said, on the clothing apparatuses of Kant, it's going to help you with the machines to go up, I don't know what, in which direction, or on these bars, it'll all be fine, extremely, it'll still be fine, very, very charming, that is say needs. But all the philosophers, that's a bit what it says, the philosophers, they are generally chaste, poor, all that, and to add it. Only, try to become what good is it to them? What is this hunt for thelorcere, what is this povertylorcere, etc. When the world had its little daily walk, but it's nothing, what happens to the little daily walk? What is watching? What... Oh, that, we should know. But in the end, that philosophers are beings of habit, I believe that habit is contemplated, it is the contemplation of something, it is habit, really habit in the true sense of the word. , it is contemplated. So, what was contemplating in these walks? What... We don't know, me my habits, if we face up and we kill, me my habits, yes, I have lots of habits, it's contemplations, sometimes it's things that only I see, that's it, a habit, really.\",\"topics\":[\"Kant\",\"critique\",\"judgment\",\"transcendental\",\"concept\",\"machine\",\"philosophy\",\"literature\"],\"length\":10039,\"wordCount\":1800},{\"letter\":\"L\",\"title\":\"Litt\xe9rature\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE - L comme Litte\u0301rature.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Litterature.mp3\",\"content\":\"So she is literature. She, not without her. Already. Yes. So the literature in philosophy is dead. You read and reread a lot of books. And interature. We call it great literature. You have always treated great writers as thinkers. Between the Kant and the Nietzsche, you shout prousses your signs, that you have a famous book and that you will increase thereafter. Les Whiskyrolles, Zola, in G. Dissence, Mazok, Kafka, American English literature. And sometimes we even have the impression that it was through literature more than through the history of philosophy that you are a work and a new thought. So I would like to know first if you have always read a lot. Oh yes. Yes Yes Yes. Ah, mum, I read a lot more philosophy, since I had to, it was part of my job, part of my apprenticeship. So I didn't have a lot of time to read novels, but I've been choosing great novels all my life, yes, more and more. Besides. So does it come down to anything for philosophy surely? It serves me. For example, what I owe to Fitzgerald, who is nevertheless not very philosophical, what I owe to Fitzgerald is immense. What I have, Fault-Mair, is very big too. Well, yes, I forget, there, I'm not well. But that's self-explanatory, precisely, based on what I've been told, because we've made a lot of progress, so it didn't escape your notice. The concept of exile I'm going to do. The concept, at the same time, pursues its task, it shows things. That is to say, he is in the branch of percepts. And here all of a sudden, these percepts, we find them in a big time. There are perpetual communications from concept to percept. Then, more, there are problems of style which are the same in philosophy and in literature. The great characters, the great characters, on the other hand, have very, very, very beautiful literary characters. They are great thinkers. I go out to fly a lot of mixed cities. It's going to be either that the owner of a cable is a great thinker. It'll either be that Martin B. is a thinker. A long way thinker is not the same kind of thinker. But he is a thinker. In any case, we must think so well that a literary work traces as many dotted concepts as percepts. Yes this. Completely. Simply, it is not the task of literature, because it cannot do everything at once. He is caught in this problem of percepts, irons to see, to make perceived and to create characters, to create characters, I am too conceived that it is to create a character. It's an amazing thing, it's a... And the philosopher is creating concepts, but it happens to communicate a lot, because the concept, in certain aspects, is a character. And the character has the dimension of a concept, I believe. I believe. This is what is common, for me, if there would be common is that the two activities. Great literature and great philosophy testify for life. That's what I called power, or earlier. He testifies for life. That's even why they don't have a lot of health. That great heights have no good health. Except sometimes, there are cases with the Hugo, yes, with the Hugo, it's so... I don't take laughs that don't have a lot of health, since on the contrary there are some who will have very high health . But why are there litterateurs who do not have great health of the type? And it's the same, perhaps, through which passes, but a flow of life. It is precisely for that. I have some ways whether it's small Ossu-Linosa health, or small Aurance health. What is this ? That's almost a bit what I said on the complaint. They saw something too big for them. They saw, it's misleading. They saw something too big for them. They are not capable of you, we cost it, it breaks them. Chevovres, that's what we got. For what ? Why Checovres? Brie at this point. He saw something. Philosophers and writers are on the same point. There are things that one manages to see, and from which, literally in a certain way, one does not come back. What is this ? It suits him a lot for the heights. But generally, it is precisely percepts at the limit of the tenable, or concepts at the limit of the thinkable. That's what does. So between a concept, between the creation of a great character and the creation of a concept, I see the link so much that it's a bit like the same company. And you, do you consider yourself a writer, the girl? How to say a literary writer? I don't know that, I don't know if I consider myself a writer in philosophy. I know that every great philosophy is a great writer. There is an esthology of romantic offer, when one is a great philosopher, I speak for you. No, because it doesn't arise, it's as if you were telling the pliers not to make music. There are cases where one can very well consume a philosophy which makes it deronant on the other hand. Why not ? It was... I don't think it would have been restarted, but he tried it. Have there been cases of great philosophers making an important novel that I know of? No, I don't see that much. But on the other hand, I see philosophers who have created characters. It happened only philosophers who created characters and characters, and characters, including Sarah Toustra. There, there are these crossings in your talk. All the time, Sarah Toustra's creation will speak. Poetitically, utterly, a successful mass, like the Platonic characters. These are points where we no longer know very well what is a concept and what is a character. That may be the poorest members. And your love for secondary authors, like Villiers de Lille-Adan or R\xe9tive de la Bretonne, have you always cultivated this affection? It was really weird to hear. Villiers de Lille-Adan is a secondary member. But the question. So, that's the question. I'm going to say, it's a strange thing, it's all appalling. It was when I was very young, I had an attitude, I had the idea of reading an author completely, his complete work. What meant that I had fiction for not secondary authors, but often sticks to authors who had written very little. And there too, it was too big for me, Victor Hugo. It wasn't so much that I was ready to tell you Victor Hugo, it wasn't good. But that on the other hand, Paul Louis Courier, I knew him almost by heart, she is not Paul Louis Courier, I knew him inside out. It really wasn't much, what he had written. So I had this taste for secondary authors, but it was so seceur, but secondary in his time compared to great... Joubert! Joubert! I know this Joubert thoroughly. We're going all that. You don't have that andale sand, so there you really know the shame. It gives me a certain prestige, I knew the unknown authors. Finally little known. Well, all of that was nonsense. I took a long time to take Victor Hugo all the same, it was grandiose. And that the humanity of the new was not one. In my love for secondary authors, it's rather... No, it's true, it's true that ten secondary authors, it's true that Russian literature doesn't exist in our soyevsky and Tolstoy . And if we have the secondary conscripts, someone like the scoff, it's so surprising that I have the scoff. Finally, that... So, finally, it's still a screen, it's for... Well, but I don't feel I don't have much to say, it's you. Anyway, it's not me... It's not me... It's their dear secondary author. No, what the only authors have is their dear husband to find in an author who is not codi. Something that seems to me to be a concept, you, a character, with its author, that has me... Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I have no research, I say, this is my technique. But apart from the proust which is a big book on an author. Literature, it is so present in your philosophy, one can say at one time that it is a reference for examples, but you have never really devoted a large book to literature, a book of thought to literature. I didn't have time, but I did. I'm walking you in and you weren't... No, I'm going to do that. I will do it because I want to. Of criticism? Criticism finally of... yes, on the problem of... yes, how? What does written mean? Yes, yes, in literature. For me, yes. Yes, it is at the top of the bottom, it says everything to the big program. We'll see if I have time. Yes. So, I asked you one last question, it's that you read and reread the classics, but we don't really get the impression that you say a lot of contemporary tors, or that you're not so many discoverers. of contemporary literature. That is to say that you always preferred to take a great author or re-read an author than to see what comes out, or what is directly to us... It's not that I don't like... Contemporarily. There, I understand what you mean. And I didn't have very fast. It's not at all that I don't like. This is a real special activity and very difficult. And where is where you have to be trained. Very difficult in a contemporary production to have the taste. It's just like people finding new shepherds. There too, it is not by its appearance. You learn that, I greatly admired people who sell galleries and who say and who have the feeling that there really is a herdsman there. And I am not capable. I have always needed so. I bring to give reason. It took me less than five years to understand a little the novelty of... Well, what's next? But the novelty of Robgrillet. I was also dumb, the dumbest, by the angle of Robgrillet in his debut. I understand is nothing. It took me time. It took me five years. Me, I am not a discoverer. So, in philosophy, I believe, there, I'm more sure than... I'm immediately sensitive to the new tone and to what is on the contrary... a hum of the repetition of things said a thousand times. But in the novel, I am very sensitive. There, I'm just sure enough of myself for what has already been disked a thousand times, it is of no interest to me. But know if. It happened to me once for Farachi. To your chosen ones, I still found it in my own way. I found someone who seemed to me a good novel, it's young. Who was, who is arming Farachi. Fine, but I'm going to say what you... There, the question you're asking me is full of justification. But I don't answer by saying, you shouldn't believe that it's when you can without judged experience of what is being done. So, I almost tell myself that what I prefer is... what happens and once again what makes me happy. It's when what I do on my side, she hides it and... Either I write it, or else I don't graze. I don't tell myself why, he's good and good, if I'm good. I'm not saying that. But there, I have a type of encounter with what is currently happening, which is of another mode. I mean, my radical inadequacy when it comes to judgment is offset by his encounters. With people doing things that echo what I do. And vice versa. For painting, the cinema, for example, it favors itself, it is a duiva encounter. Is it for the free laughs, it's hard to imagine, going into a free laughs and looking at the books that have come out in the past two months? Yes indeed. But it may also be linked to the idea that it won't force you. Not in... It's not in my head, and it's not preconceived that's obvious, that literature isn't going very well. Right now. And then she's so corrupt, so we're not even talking about all that, she's so corrupted by the system. Distribution, prices, etc. That... That it's even more worth it. You, we'll move on to M.

A full one. It's like... We can, Jean. We can. Go ahead. So M, it's illness. Here, come. Just after the end point, a series of differences and repetitions, 1968, who was hospitalized for very serious tuberculosis. You who had what there is about the nest, you espis our aques, she is a great ferryman, she is poor health, you have had to live, from now on, 68 with the disease. Did you know if you had tuberculosis for a long time, or did you know if your disease had been there for a long time? Evil, yes, I knew I had something wrong for a long time. But... I think I am when liked by people. I didn't really want to know and then... as people liked, I obviously thought it was cancer, which I was in no hurry, and then... well, I didn't know it was TB, but I knew...until I coughed up blood, yes. So... Me, I am a child, tuberculosis, but before no, it no longer presented any danger, that is to say that there were antibiotics. It was quite serious, 10 years before, or 3 years before, it must have been the beginning, a few years before, I couldn't survive it, but there, there was no longer any problem, in addition, it is a disease that does not involve pain. I can say that... I was very sick, but it is a great privilege, a disease without suffering, a curable disease, without suffering, it is a bit of a disease, that is to say it It's a disease, yes, it's true, but before, I never had an immense health, I would say, I was always very tired. So is the question fascinated enough, someone who proposes, I'm not saying, I'm not talking about the success of the company, but someone who proposes or who loves, who proposes, who has how resumed to think, to try to think, do I believe that the State indeed of a very weak and favorable health? Not at all that one is listening to one's own life, but thinking is all the same, for me, it seems to me to be listening to life. So it's because it's happening, either listening to life, it's so much different, thinking about your own health, but I think that fragile health favors, kind of listening, when I said, it's great height like Laurent de Sous-Py in a, in a way, they saw something too big, so big that... It was too much for them, it's true that you can't think of if you're not already in a field, which is that it doesn't have your frances a bit, that is to say that they make you fragile. Good, good, I have always had a somewhat fragile health effect, and there, that is confirmed from the moment when I was, when I had been tuberculous, I acquired all the rights of a poor health. It was... Yes. It's fine as you say. But your relationship to doctors and medications changed from that moment on, that is to say, you had to see doctors, you had to take medication on a regular basis, and that is like a constraint, it's as if you were telling yourself that doctors don't tell you much. Yes, personally, it's not a question of anyone, because I've always had your crush on Chagomain doctors, high school students. But it is a type of power, or the way in which they manipulate power, in order to also rediscover, one does not know, there is no question already, as if the mentienne is the behaving being, the totality, the tucked over the totality, the way they shackle power appears to me to the gods, these are, they are to the gods, as physicians they are to the gods, I have a great queen for, not for the physicians person contrary, which is often charming, but I have a great queen for medical power and the way doctors use will be able. There is something that delights me, me, and it is at the same time what is unhappy, it is when I arrive as he works more and more with devices, there are tests, it is moreover one of the devices for the patient, and proof of which one has the impression that it has absolutely no interest, except to comfort the endeagnostic to confirm it, but if this demeter will nevertheless be notat there, they are already the endeagnostic that the trials believed, and that she has not just comforted, they play with these trials in an inadmissible way, so what made me happy was each time that I passed or that I was able to pass under to our devices. That is to say that my breath was too thin, could be angist in the same way, or else they couldn't give me, I don't know what it's called, a doctor's grip, we didn't couldn't do it to me. An ecografe, yes, because I also passed under the same, and my joy is that at that time, they are crazy, nothing. I believe that, at that time, they leave their poor patients, they accept very well to be mistaken by agnostics, but they do not accept that they have passed, they do not speak of the like. But if, in, I find that, then they're too stupid, they're too... they're too... how shall I put it? It's... or so when he gets into culture, it's a disaster. Finally, it's a funny, it's his funny Jean-L\xe9metzard. And my consolation is that it wins a lot of people, but who don't have time to really spend it, we're going to have no time to enjoy it, because there's even a life extremely hard. Well yes, L\xe9metzard didn't pull much, depending on the personalities, that once he can be exquisite, but in their function, they are... it's really... they treat people like dogs . So that's really the class struggle, because if you're a puriche, they're already much more polite, except in surgery, or there, it's a special case, he surgery, it's still another case. But L\xe9metzard... L\xe9metzard, it's not going well, it needs a real strong one, but still. Yes, look, problem. And L\xe9metz-cammons that you have to take, do you have the time? Yes, I like that, yes. It doesn't piss me off, L\xe9metz-Cammons, it doesn't piss me off. It tires, they give up. But that put you, it is to take L\xe9metz-cammons? When there are a lot of them, in my current state, yes, because there are a lot of them, so this little weather, every morning, it has something, it's a foundry food, you know. But I feel like it's very useful too, yes. Very useful, I have always been, even in the domain of the apsyche, who has tried for drugs, for... I have always been for the pharmacy, what. And this fatigue, when we talked about it, which is very much linked to your illness, but which you say was already there before the illness, we think of the text by Glanchot, on fatigue, in the profession. But fatigue is a big part of your life. That is to say that sometimes, you even have the impression that it's an excuse, for many things that bother you. It serves you fatigue, and fatigue has always served you. Me, I think, here it is. When you get hit in that, you come back to the theme of power, what is it... realizing a bit of power, doing what you can do, what's in your power. I mean, it's an old one, it's complex, because what gives me a power, for example fragile health or an illness, can it be about knowing what use to make of it for a through it recover some power. So, and the certain that the disease must be used for something that one remains it. I'm not just talking about life where it has to give a feeling. For me, the disease is not something. It's not an enemy for me. Because it's not something that gives the feeling of death. It is something that eclipses the feeling of life. And not at all in the sense of one plus, when I would like to live, and as if once cured, I'm going to start living. I believe that I anger nothing more object in the world, than what is called a bon vivant. It's a good living. On the contrary, the living great men are very small in health. So I come back to my question. I love the disease, it needles him with a kind of vision of life or of his friend. When I say life vision and life, it's really when. I say see life, but it is crossed by it, way-for. It said that. It gives a vision of life the disease. Life in all its power, in all its beauty. It seemed safe to me. But how to have secondary benefits of the disease, there it is all that, it is that it is necessary to make use of it to be a little more free. You have to use it. It is very unfortunate. Sounds like it's overworking what not to do. This supermanais, if that I worked and achieve any power, it's worth it. But this supermanais socially. I don't understand. I don't understand, but this overwork, because he has too many customers. So we shoot and go. We shoot and leave. There, the disease is. It is indeed, it is this liberated of things between. You can't break free in an ordinary life. Me, personally, I never liked to travel. I have never been able to issue a travel. I respected travel very much. But the fact of having such good health assured me a great deal to decline any trip. Or go to bed too late. It's okay, it was still very hard. Once I was in such poor health, he was involved all the time. And then it was very, very good. And fatigue, you see it as the disease. Fatigue is something else. For me, it's... I did what I could today. I did what I could today. That's it. The day is over. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. The day is over. Fatigue is really biologically the day is over. So she may have to abduct and for other reasons, for social reasons. But fatigue is the biological formulation of what the day is over. You didn't tear yourself to tears. And in that regard, if you take it that way, it's not an unpleasant feeling. It's unpleasant if we haven't done anything. I rejoiced. But otherwise, it's fine. It's good. It is states of fatigue. I have always been sensitive to cotton states. It's cotton fatigue. I'm coming. I'm coming. It stretches you. I'm coming. I'm coming. It stretches you. If he comes, the woman something. That's how it should have a name in music. I don't know what it's called. A cousin. It's a burst of fatigue. I'm going to talk to you a bit beforehand about old age, about your very special relationship with food. Oh, old age. Yes, he is talking about food. First, because the food that brings you, which seems to approach strength and vitality, that is to say the moale, the lobster, brings you very particular food. And you don't really like to eat. You have to feed me. No no no no no. For me to eat another thing. I mean, if I was trying to define quality for me to eat, that's your middle. I believe that's the thing. For me, it's the most boring thing in the world. Drink, but that was good, we did it. Drinking was an extremely interesting thing. Eating never interested me. It bothers me to pay. So eat only heavy. Eating with someone I love changes everything. But it doesn't transform the food. It allowed me to bear to eat. To make it not so boring, though I would say. Fact that I can eat alone, or that's not a lot of people are like that. Eating alone, everyone says, proves how much better eating is, because most people admit it. Eating alone is a humble life agreement. So, that said, of course, but done. But done, it's a bit special to see the universal disgust. I'm not forgotten about other people's cheese. Yes, you don't like doing it. So, you have to... Among people who taste cheese, I'm a fan of being tolerant. There will be no harm or no chasing. Those who have the Jewish cheese, is still supported. This taste which seems more or less of the same type as cannibalism, for example, by the absolute nervous. So, if you're going to be asked, in fact, what to recompose my favorite meal, and there, which for me would be a crazy event, it's true that I always come back to three things. Because there are three things which are not the sublimeques which nevertheless are clean, mented or aunts. It is the tongue, the brain and the brolle. So, I imagine, these are very nourishing things. So, already, to be worth all that, it would be... But there are restaurants, among the few restaurants, among the... I learned it, who serve you brolle, but I can't do anything more eat afterwards, while seizing, it is a lot of the small soft cards. It's quite fascinating, by the way. The brain and then the tongue. So, if I tried to put his high point with what we said, it's a kind of tridity, because we could say, and it's too much indactotes, all that, we could say that the brains , it's God, it's the father, that the brolle, it's the son, since it's the hyoverterium that are little crads, God, it's the skull, the little crads turned, it's is the son. So the bullshit is the son, it's Jesus, and the tongue is the sane, which is the very power of the tongue, or else it could be okay too, I don't know , it's the concept, the brain, the monk, it's the ridge, and the language, it's the percept, we're not going to ask too much why, but I feel that there, these are very tridities.. There you have it, well, that would be it, a fantastic meal for me. Has he aged? Has it happened to me three times at the same time? Maybe a birthday amnimes with fresh meals like that? One done! And don't you intend to eat these three things since you tell us about your old age? That would be too yeah, but it's also important, in old age, yes, but he listens to old age. There is someone who knew how to talk about old age and rebound to Raymond de Vos, the object always a little, but he said the best, I find that old age is an age, but it is splendid, it's splendid, of course, there's a lot of entanglement, we took some nits, but the worst is when someone says to you, no, you're passive, he doesn't understand what that's the complaint. Me, I beach myself, I say, I'm old, I revoke the powers of old age and powers, and here is someone telling me, believe in merit, no, you're not that old, the evening, I I have a slap in the face, I don't know if I do, and it's not a question of telling me, of telling me that I'm in my complete old age, and it's a question of telling myself, but we don't it's not so old, that on the contrary, to tell me, in brothers, yes, but it's pure joy, I mean, joy comes from where, apart from this slowness, if old age is terrible, you mustn't laugh all the same, if old age is terrible, what is it, it's pain and misery, but it's not old age, I mean, a thing that's pathetic, what makes that old age is a sad thing, it is the poor people who have neither enough money to live on, nor minimal health, nor this little health of which I speak, and who have suffering, it is that's mommie's, but that's not old age, old age isn't bad at all, old age with enough money and enough health left, that's great, that's great why, I first of all believe, there is only old age left, first of all we arrived, it's not nothing, it's not a feeling of triumph, but in fact, it's that we've just arrived . We have arrived after all in a world that includes wars, salt\xe9s of virus, we will go through all that, viruses, wars, mess, we have just arrived. And it's a moment, it's no longer a question of one thing, it's being, being. There is no longer being this, being that is being. The old man is someone who is, it's a mess. We can always say, oh, that's beautiful, no, it's not a good death, it's very short, it has acquired the right to be very short, that's it. Because to an old man all the same, someone old, he can always say, I have plans, but it's true, it's not true, it's plans, not the way someone , 30 years, projects. I hope to do well there, these two books that she is authoring, on literature, on philosophy, I hope well, but without fail, I am free from any project, I am free from any project, I'm free to, we're more likely, you know when we're old. 14, ha! We have more, we have more susceptibility, we have more, we have more fundamental disappointment, when I mean, we have more, we are much more disinterested, we really like people for themselves. Me, I have the impression that it created a perception, for example, of things that I hadn't seen before, of elegances that I hadn't been sensitive to. There, I had it for better, because, I look at someone for himself, almost as if it were lying for me, in the rush, the as if I were, in the rush, a a percept to extract from him, a percept all that, all that makes old age, an angel, and the days think of an annulment, with their cancers, fatigue, fatigue, but it's not an illness, fatigue, it's something else, it's said death, it's still, it's once again the signal, the end of the day. So well, over years ago, me, with old age, but I'm done avoiding them to ward them off, it's easy to ward off, it's kind of like werewolves or not lying or like vampires , I really like that, as you shouldn't be alone, at night when it starts to happen, it's there, you're too slow to say to yourself, it's going to do so, there are things to avoid , it will be for you, but, and then the wonder is that people make you white, society makes you white, so that's let down by society, it's so hard, it's not just society, but he is much held in hook, but to someone who is not demongaged, or who is not retired, cannot imagine what the joy, to be let down by society. So obviously, when I hear old people, it's those who want to be near old people, it's those who would like their peace so old as that, they can't stand retirement, they don't know why, they have that by reading refunds, they discovered less, they discovered something, they can't stand, or else, I don't think, regret, at the retirement that blows away, it's Japanese cases, perhaps, I don't think, in retirement who, who, can't find themselves doing something, that's it, it's berneil, I mean, yes, we're letting you go, so we'll wash things over for you, or else, I'm a fig , you got stuck a little so that it falls, that all the parasites you've had on the dowry all your life, bah, and so much, and what's left around you, nothing but people that you love, people who remain with you and who support you and who also love you when needed, the rest tempts you, and again, when I speak, at that moment it becomes very hard when there is something nosaltres, that society, I no longer go along with it, that we talk, that we talk, the life of retirement, all the arms, it's the shoe. So I know that society, I am ignorant, I am completely ignorant, society. So, the catastrophe is when there is someone who believes that I am still part of it, whereas he simply is completely different, because what we do, in itself -even, it's so much part of a good old age dream, but who asked me for an interview, an entretiote, or that, I told him, but it's not going well, the head is not common, that I'm old and that society has let me down, but that's good, I think we take things to heart, it's not the old people that we need, we have to talk about... yes, he you have to talk about the biseire and the suffering, then that, when you're old, worse terrible and suffering, there, I know, there's no good port, that's for sure, but if not, then, an old pure, that he is nothing, a little old, that is being, yes. But yet, as you are sick, tired and old, it may be perfect, distinguishing the three things, it is sometimes difficult for your people around you, they are less old, less sick and less tired that you, your children, or your wife? But children, but children, there are not many problems, because there could be, if it was younger, but like, they are old enough to live on their own, and I do not breathe dependent, and so it's a reaction, when they say, really, he looks too tired, but anyway, I don't think there's a problem with the children, and with Fanny, I think that it's not a problem either, even if, it's, even maybe, I don't know, it's very difficult, only from someone, we love, what would he do , in what would he have done in another life? Alright, if we're not going to travel, as she might have wished, but what else have we discovered, that we wouldn't have discovered, it's had traveled , she always had, she also, always had very strong literary information, it allowed her, what did it allow her to discover in the planid remances, and it is well worth the trips, all that, well course, there are problems, as I would say, one exceeds. And finally, the projects, for example, when you approach your projects for the next book, the books on literature, it is last, what is philosophy? How funny is it to approach them old, these projects, when you said earlier, more or less, there are no more funny things there too. Ah, not because it's a wonderful thing, you know. First of all all the same, there is a whole evolution, and when you are old, you have a certain idea of what you want to do, which becomes more and more pure. I mean, which is getting more and more refined. I give the link to the famous lines of a Japanese designer, such pure lines, if there is nothing, there is nothing, a little line, all that. I can conceive that, I project myself from an old, something that is so pure, if there is nothing, and at the same time, that is everything, that is so marvelous, I mean, to arrive at a sobriety. It may come that you have. So what is philosophy? That, research, what is philosophy? First of all, I find it handled at a good margin. We are going to research, what is philosophy? To have the feeling that I know it, that I am it, the only one to know it, that I know it, therefore also, I will happen to die there under a nobody bus, do not appear to see, to do the philosophy, all that is extremely pleasant for me. But now I could have done a book on what is philosophy? 30 years ago. I know it would have been very, it would have been a very, very different book, very very different from what I am consuming now, or I would like to arrive at a kind of sobriety and such that... Yes, then, well I would succeed or not, but I know that it is now that I must consume, that before, I would not have known how to do it now, I tell myself that I am capable of doing it, but, in anyway, it will not look like a good point.\",\"topics\":[\"illness\",\"body\",\"health\",\"suffering\",\"difference\",\"concept\",\"philosophy\"],\"length\":22711,\"wordCount\":4176},{\"letter\":\"N\",\"title\":\"Neurologie\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE - N comme Neurologie.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Neurologie.mp3\",\"content\":\"So she is neurology and brain. Don't relige, it's a robot. Oh, it's very hard, a neurology. It's true that neurology always goes easy, but why? What goes through someone's head when they have unity? I prefer when he has unity, when he has no idea, it happens a bit like in an electric ticket. What's going on ? How does it communicate to the terror of the head? What happens before talking about communication, etc. Already, how did it communicate in the head? Or the head of an idiot, I mean, it's the same thing also someone who has unity or an idiot. All the same, it does not take this step by preformed path by association. Absolutely. Well, what's going on here? If we knew, I'm going to have the impression that we would understand everything. That interests me, for example. And the electric solutions are lightly vanilla. Two ends of error, one in the brain can very well come into contact. This is even what is called electrical processes in the synapses. And then, in other cases, a much more complex perhaps where it's discontinued. And where there is a flaw in it. And me, I have the impression that the brain is full of strong. And that it jumps, and that it jumps in a probabilistic regime. That there are probability ratios between two sequences. That it is much, much more. Some. Very, very certain. Internal communications, within the same brain, are basically at certain. Subject to laws of probability. But what makes me think of something? That is to say we can always say these eyes, the questions, he has inventory, it is the association of ideas. 15. It's still. So, one must almost wonder. For example, a concept is given to a painting, a work of art contemplated, look. It takes almost trying to make my brain map. It matches. There would be continuous communications, discontinuous communications from one point to another. There is one thing that struck me a lot. So there, we might join what you wanted. What struck me a lot was a story that physicists use a lot, under the name of the baker's transformation. You take like a square of kneading machine and you pull them, requiring them, peturabat, you do a re-drawing, etc., etc., you do your transformations. And at the limit of X transformation, of completely contiguous points. Inevitably, it is led to be contrary very very distant. And there are no distinct points which have the sequence of X transformation, we are at contiguous points. I say to myself, we are looking for something in his head. Aren't there shuffling of stalks, here there aren't tricks or two points at such a baman, at such a state of my idea, there are two points, I don't see how the approach and communicate. And then at the end of this transformation, the valleys are in there next to each other. All that. I would almost say a concept between a concept or a work of art. It has returns to produced the mind and to mechanism at its core. There are resemblances which are so very very moving that I just want to feel badly about the question how do we think or what differs from it and the question. And at the same time to think and to brain absolutely mixed. I would say I believe more if you have the future of the molecular biology of the brain than the future of computer science or theory and any theory of communication. And you always made room for 19th grade psychiatry, which was capable of neurology and brain science over psychoanalysis. And you have always maintained this priority of psychoanalysis over psychoanalysis. And absolutely. And it continues? Yes Yes Yes Yes. I said a while ago the pharmacy which also has it having relations with them. Pharmacy, its positive action on the brain and the cerebral structures that could be found at the malecular level in cases of schizophrenia, all that interests me. We came more certain than the apsychiatrix and the dualists. And there it is a question of method because you are not in secret. In fact, this is a question extended to science. You are rather at the ideal rate when you don't have a neurobiology journal or if you don't have a scientific journal. You're not very good at math. Contrary, we make off that you studied, well that we were mathematics graduates, it's that we were good in mathematics, hypnosis, it's an idea to say it, is very good mathematics. How do you manage to read when you have an idea and you need something that interests you and you don't necessarily understand everything? How are you doing? I already have something that comforted me a lot. I am convinced that there are several readings of the same thing. And when already in philosophy, that I strongly believe in it, there is no need to be a philosopher to read philosophy. There is that philosophy is susceptible, only susceptible, that it needs readings at the same time. A non-philosophical reading of philosophy is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, there would be no beauty in a philosophy. That is to say that non-specialists, read philosophy. Non-philosophical nature of philosophy, does nothing. She has her sufficiency. Simply, it is a reading. That may not go for all philosophy. I do not see the possibility of a non-philosophical reading of 40, for example. But he is a funder. I mean that a country in the ispinence, not at all possible that a march in read, it is a funder. A niche is even more self-evident. All the philosophers I love are like that. So, I believe very in no need to understand. It's as if... understanding is a certain level of reading. But it's a bit as if you were telling me to appreciate, for example, Gaugat or a large painting. You still need to know about it. Obviously, you have to know about it, it's better. But that there are also extremely authentic, extremely powerful, extremely violent emotions. In a total ignorance of painting, it is obvious that someone can believe himself. Like a real shot of your air, a painting, and not knowing but nothing about the painting, even. Someone can be extraordinarily loved by music and or by such a musical work, without knowing a word. Me, for example, I am extraordinarily loved by Loulou. By your bag, yes. I'm not even talking about the concert you, but Morgan, no, I didn't laugh at him, maybe who loved me the most in the world. Well, I know well that it would be better that it is even better to have a competent perception. But I said that everything that matters in the world is susceptible to a double, in the realm of the spirit and susceptible to a double reading. Provided that the double reading is not something you do randomly, as an autodidate. It's something we do from these problems that come from elsewhere. I mean, it's as philosophers that I have a non-musical perception of music and that for me it can be extraordinarily moving. Likewise, it is as a musician, as not as this that, it is that the who can have a non-philosophical reading of philosophy. If there is not this second reading which is not even second, if there are not two readings at the same time, it is like the two wings of a bird, if one is not very good, like the two wings of a bird. If there are not two readings at the same time, even a philosopher must learn to read a great philosopher not philosophically. The typical example for me is that it's once again Spillons-en. To see Spillons-en, paperback and then read it like that. Well, in my opinion, we have as many emotions as at a great musical work and in a certain way, the question is not to understand. But in my courses, I'm sure that the courses I did, but it's not so obvious that people sometimes understand and sometimes don't. And we're all like that in a book, sometimes we understand, sometimes we don't. So I come back to your science question then. That, I think, is really... Which means, in a way, we are always at the cutting edge of our ignorance. And that's where you have to settle. You have to settle down to the point of your knowledge, or to the point of your ignorance, it's the same thing to have something to say. If I wait to know what I am going to write, and if I wait to know it and to know... There, there, if I wait to know what I am talking about, and I will always have to wait for what I will say in a canadere top. If I risk, by that, if I also settle down and if I speak sarcastically about what I don't know, it's another absentee from integrating. But I'm talking about this very border that separates knowledge from non-knowledge. It's here. I mean, that's where you have to sit to have something to say. So, turning for me, it's the same. And the confirmation at the JV is that I've always had reports with scholars and not time. They never took me for knowledge, they don't think I understand much, but they tell me it works. Finally, a small donation, no, they walk each other. When I tighten, not z'en, simply it would be necessary... You do not want that I fissons if my z\xe9coche, it is not what to call that. If I give an example, then I'm going to give an example of it all very sand. Here is a herdsman whom I love as much as born water. What is born water? What if I... really, I seek to sum up in the formed, what is born water? He notices a prodigious thing. When I said, so that takes us back to the beginning, what is it to have an idea? What is the idea of born water? The idea of born water is that... light forms figures itself. It is that there are figures of light. It's very new, maybe in others, that long before we had this people? If there appeared born water, it is because we tried this creation of figures which are figures formed by light, figures of light. There are no figures of light. And not at all which is very different. Aspects that light takes on when it encounters an object. This is how he detaches himself from any object, which makes a pasture that no longer has objects. And I'm not going to have him say very nice things to him, he says when he just revels in cubism. But finally, his donkeys had succeeded in breaking the object. There is breaking the fruit bowl. And now the cubists spend their time wanting to re-school it. Therefore, what counts to eliminate the object, is enough that the rigid figures, with the geometric figure, figures of pure light. That's one thing. Pictorial fanning and selling of the onin. So I don't know the dates, it doesn't matter. There is a way or an aspect of relativity, the theory of relativity. I just don't have enough, maybe I don't need. If you don't need to know much, it's being, they say, hottodidin who is dangerous. But we don't need to know much. I know just like that that one of the aspects of relativity is precisely instead of having submitted. How to say, geometric lines. No, instead of having submitted, the lines of light, the line followed by the light. The lines of light, to the geometric line, starting with the oblique experience to the sound, it is the reversal. It is the lines of light that will condition the geometric lines. The advice scientifically is a considerable reversal. It will change everything, since the line of light will not at all the constancy of the geometric line to exchange everything. I'm not saying it's the whole thing, it's the aspect of relativity that gets the most out of the experience of mechanism. I'm not going to say oner, apply relativity. I will celebrate the meeting between a pictorial attempt and a scientific attempt that must be unrelated to the other. I was saying the same thing, so I'll take an example. Just that Roman spaces are not beyond me. I don't know well. I know just enough to know that it is a space that is being built, piece by piece. And whose connections between pieces are not ready to be determined. But for quite another reason, I need a concept of space that doesn't become a connection and that's not ready to be determined. I'm not going to spend 50 years of my life trying to understand himane because when I'm over 50, I won't be advanced in my philosophical concept. And I will also hands. And I see a strange space that everyone knows as space in a braising film where space is rarely global where space is built piece by piece. We see a piece of space, for example a piece of cells in the condemned man, the cell in my vague memory and never seen in its entirety, yet it is a small space. I'm not talking about his custody, we prick him, everything is prodigious. They are small pieces of space that connect. So, we are almost determined why? And that's why it will be manual, hence the importance of the chews and pressures. It's the mask that goes. And indeed, in the pique pourqu\xeate, it is the speed with which the infegres to the intuces and the stolen object pass that will determine the sale connections of small spaces. Nor am I going to say that Bresson applies to the Rizmanian space. I say, there can be an encounter between a philosophical concept, a scientific notion and an aesthetic percept. And wow, perfect. I say, in science, I believe, I know just enough to evaluate encounters. If I knew more, I would do science, not philosophy. So. So, at the limit, I speak well of what I do not know. But I talk about what I don't know, based on what I know. Besides, it's all a matter of... I don't know tact. You don't have to fool around. You don't have to have the time to know when you don't know. And... Again, just like I've had encounters with pasta, well these are the best days of my life. I had some encounter not, not a physical encounter. I wrote, I have the encounters with pasta, the greatest entreu, and it is in size, in size, in size, in sick. Yes, there is something and there is something. I don't know the level of the compliment. He doesn't know me, he just had to pay compliments to someone like me. And we don't know each other. There is something happening. What was badly met, squared the obese? Me, I've never done theatre, I've never understood anything about theatre. You have to believe that there was something going on too. There are people of science. Also who does it work for? I've known mathematicians who there, when they were kind enough to read what I'm doing, they said, for us, it fits absolutely. No, it's bad, because I seem to get a kind of satisfaction, out of it being quite naughty, but that's to answer the question. For me, the question was not... Do I know a lot of science or not, can I learn a lot. The important thing is not to read nonsense. It is to establish these eco. It is a phenomenon of listening between a concept, a percept, a function, since the sciences do not proceed with concepts, perhaps proceed from functions. It was garment, I need rymanes spaces. Yes, I know it requires, I don't know what it would be, but that's enough.\",\"topics\":[\"neurology\",\"brain\",\"consciousness\",\"perception\",\"concept\",\"machine\",\"philosophy\",\"power\"],\"length\":15016,\"wordCount\":2690},{\"letter\":\"O\",\"title\":\"Op\xe9ra\",\"filename\":\"L'Abecedaire de GILLES DELEUZE - O comme Ope\u0301ra.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Opera.mp3\",\"content\":\"So, high is opera. Opera, we have just learned, is to rebel a little. It was a bit of a joke, because, apart from Vo\xeftti\xe8c and Loulou de Berge, we can say that opera is not entirely in your business or in your interests. It's something, you can talk about the exception made for Berge, but unlike Foucault or Ch\xe2telet, who is but very much the P\xe9rait-Aliens, you've never listened to much music or particularly P\xe9ra. You see what would interest you more, it's the popular song. The popular song is particularly edited-piaf. You have a passion for edite-piaf. And I would like you to seize a little. No, it's good, you're a little sovereign there. First of all, I was able to listen to a lot of music there, bah bah. A long time ago. And then, I try because I told you, it's not possible. It's not possible. It's a taste, it's to be there, it's too much time. It takes too much time. You have to have time. I do not have the time. I still have a lot to do. I'm not talking about doing, not gourmet, there. No social gourmet. I want to make creations or things. I don't have time to listen to music, or not enough time to listen to it. Good. For example, each bed worked, we listen to opera. Yes, yes, that, that, it's an amette. I couldn't have that. He was listening to opera. Yes. But I don't know if he did it when he was working maybe. When he dresses people, that I understand. Me, it covered, we said them. When he had enough. But in the end, it's not heartfelt. So he kinda got... What makes me get it? I preferred the question, it is more abandoned. If you turn her, huh? Why is there a community between a popular song and a musical masterpiece? That's it, it's easy. The edit Pierre, well yes, because I think it's edited Pierre, maybe the singer, that means an extraordinary voice. And then in addition, it's the mess. This thing of singing out of tune and perpetually catching the wrong note. It is this kind of system in imbalance. It's not to catch up, because that's going to be the case with any style. I like it a lot, me, I like it a lot, because that's the question I ask myself about everything. So at the level of popular song, I like it, I always had the same pain. But what does it bring new? We heard... Second... Fine. And yes, I say, it's above all things and on all productions, that the question that arises above all is, what new does it bring? If it has been done 10 times 100 times, it can be done very well. But we are done, I understand. Perfectly, does Rob Griez say, when he says... He's Balsak, that's obviously, Sunday Genie. But that it is interesting today to write novels like Balsak by doing. Even more, it dirties Balsak's novels more than that to... Oh, it's like that for everything. So, to what touched me, for example, with an edit-piaf, what is the new line compared to the previous generation, compared to Brother and the other big one of G\xe9rya, and compared to Fr\xe8re and Damiach, because she brought again, what did she bring, even in the singer's attubnue, in all that, Piaf's voice, I was extremely sensitive to Piaf's voice. In the songs more band\xe8nes, it is necessary to think, for example. When that's what I mean, you have to think about hanging out. What was the novelty of the songs hanging around, but we had never literally, we had never heard singing. Like this, this way, buy it. It's... Now, what I mean, if that's what it invented on this point, for philosophy, for painting, for everything, for art. So whether it's the popular song or whether it's the rest, the same or the sport, we'll see when we go to play sports. But it's exactly the same. What's happening again? So, if we interpret that in the sense of fashion, no, it's the opposite. What's happening again is something that isn't fashionable, that it may become fashionable, but that isn't fashionable, and then we don't try it. By finishes, we do not try it. It's something that makes people wonder. Well, when we treat the Sebers to sing, we list ourselves a madman. A madman, well, today, it seems more like a madman to us. But it is marked end. He was a madman and in a way, he still is. And said, Pierre, that suits you, it seems big enough to me, you find yourself. And that the other Frenchman, you've perished a lot too, you're... The other Frenchman, I thought I saw it right for you. There, I don't know, I thought I saw only French there, on the other hand, too, something new. There are a lot of them, I don't want to name them. It's a big sad thing, that's it. We sang like that, said, seen 100 times, thousands of times. It is, in addition, there is strictly not the slightest voice. He is not looking for anything. At least that makes me just bring something new and look for something. He says, Pierre, what is it dear dear? So there, all I can say is the little health and the big life. What he saw in life, the power of life. And what he broke, etc. And the examples, we could have, badly each time, the name of stone sayings, in what we said close, it's over there. So, French, I was sensitive first, he is looking for something. It looks for the directive of spectare, a bit new, a spectare than the song. He advanced to song spectare, that's what obviously involved the baccalaureate, moreover, but anyway, where you have better, it allows him to make sound heads too. And until the end, he wasn't happy with less than one thing, because it's the lyrics, it was stupidity, and that counts all the same, in the song, the lyrics, it was weak, he passed his decisions to hang these texts and to arrive at qualities of texts greater, like Alexandre and Alexandre, which was a good song, all sangre. So, today, I don't know, but when you watch TV, it's the rights of urtraite, and when I'm tired, I can open on TV. I can say that the more channels there are, the more it seems to be, and the more nullity it is, but a radical nullity, the regime of competition is not to compete with each other, although that may be , it is to produce the same to eterter a nullity, thanks to the competition. And knowing what is going to make the listener, there is to listen to him here rather clearly, but it was farant, the way he says, we can even call that a field, we can even no longer call it first because the voice does not exist, there is no longer any right, there is no more. But hey, don't forget neither we don't. I mean, what touches me is a kind of area that would be how to be shaped by popular song and by music. Yet, and what is it, huh? So with Ph\xe9lix, I think we did a good job, because it's one thing and he feels me, when I said, I could say in a pinch, if someone told me, but what a philosophical concept, you have product, and if you talk about creating concepts, we have at least produced a very important philosophical concept, that of Ritournel. And the Ritournel, it's for me, it's this point like that. Because, what that, let's put it, the Ritournel, it's a small field. Here, here, here, here. When do I say, here, here. I do philosophy, that's it. But of philosophy, I say to myself when did I do, that I sing in, I say that I sing in three occasions, I sing in when I make a sister, and that I followed my mables, there has a radio background, that is to say that when I am at home, I sing in when I am not at home, and I try to regain the scheme, when at night, during anxiety, I look for my way and I give myself courage by singing between there. I go to my diagram. And then, I sing when I say to God, I leave, and in my heart, I will carry. It's also, all these popular songs, to God, I leave, and in my heart, I will take, when I leave my house to go to God, to go where. In other words, one of my tournels for me is absolutely linked, to that puts us back to ha, to d'y mal, to the problem of territory, and of leaving or entering a territory, it's that is to say, to the problem of detertoriatization. I return to my territory, where I try, or else I deteritorialize myself, to say, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving my territory. You come, but she doesn't with the music. You have to progress when you create a council, for that, I avoke the image of the brain. It would be necessary to take my brain at this moment, presently, that I say to myself, the vacuum. What is a void, a void, that was always that. Everything I would have been the voice as song, which is absence, song, according to its positions in relation to the territories. My territory, the territory that I no longer have, the territory that I am trying to regain, that's what a leader is, whether it's at Chouberg, that's basically it. And I think that's it, that's what affects him. L'enceux jise is music, it's the story of becomings, of the powers of becoming. It was something like that. Well, then, it wants to be great, or it can be mediocre. But... What then is truly great music? It seems like an operation to me, in fact, the music artist operation. But it's really that they start from Ritournel, I don't know, I'm even talking about the most abstract musicians. I understand that everyone is a type of Ritournel. He talks about little aeros, he talks about little Ritournelis. You have to see the proust twenty-eels, three notes and then two. There is a little Ritournel at the base of Touvate, there is the base of September and of... It's from Ritournel. You have to find it in the music under the music, the Ritournel. It is something prodigious. And then what happens? He's a great musician. It's not Ritourvels which me one after the other. But it's Ritournels that will melt into an even deeper Ritournel. It's all the Ritournels, almost territories, from such territories, to territories that are going to be organized within a kind of immense, whereas we must say immense Ritournel, which is a cosmic Ritournel. All that Stochhausen says about music and the cosmos is to take up themes that were commonplace by an employee with a lot of sense. But I'm very much for case satisfaction. Music relates to the cosmos in a way. Good, well, I take a musician, while I also admire a lot and who touches me a lot of misfortune. What are side chambers? The rooms weren't good, can't say better. It is perpetually, like an element of youth. You perpetually have a little Ritournel, sometimes based on two bells and two cows. Yes, it's unfortunate. It was extremely moving the way in which all these little Ritournel which are already brilliant musical works, Ritournel de tavern, Ritournel de Berger, Ritournel, etc. Arrange to be composed in a kind of great Ritournel which will be the side room. So, another example was needed, I would say really Bartok who was probing. Obviously, he is an immense musician, a very, very great genius. The way in which local jingles, national minority jingles, etc. are taken up in a work, in a work that we have not finished exploring. So, I think that music is a bit... Yes, to unite it with painting, it's exactly the same thing. When Cl\xe9 says Iran boss Paul Visible, Iran Visible implies forces that are not visible. Musicia is the same thing. Iran audible forces that are not audible. Iran by the audible, Iran audible, something that didn't smash her. Iran audible earth music. Iran audible music from the front, etc. Exactly, almost like the philosopher, will go thinkable forces which are not thinkable, which are rather of a brutal nature, of a brutal nature. So it's this communion of the little ritornello with the big ritornello, which didn't define music for me. That would be it, and that mighty. It's powerful to carry on a truly cosmic level. It's as if the stars are churning to sing a little air of a bell and a cow, a little air of a shepherd. It is rather the reverse. Bells and cows are suddenly raised to the status of saleste noise or business noise of one, to do our. That's what... But still I have the impression I won't be explained why. Everything you tell me and this musical tradition, that what you are looking for in music, the refrain, is still visual. That you, your business is the visual. Much more. So, I understand that the point the dible is linked to the cosmic force like the visual. But you don't go to the concert, you know what bothers you, you don't listen to music, whereas the exhibitions, you go at least once a week, and you have a practice. It's not just a possibility, but in fact, there is only one answer I can make. A single fundamental interested day in a literature is style. Style is auditory. It is the auditory pu. I don't know the distinction you make between the vis-vel. When I rarely go to a concert, because it's more difficult to hold your place before. It's part of life and very practical life. As long as the gallery is a painting exhibition, you won't retain its place before. But every time I've been to the concert, I always find it too long, because I have very little receptivity. But I always read quite emotions. There, I think, I'm not sure you're right, but I think you're wrong anyway. That's not entirely true. In any case, I know that the music will give emotions. It's not raining, it's even more difficult. Talking about music is even more difficult than talking about painting. It's almost the top talking about music. That's almost the whole thread... Well, a lot of philosophers have talked about music. No, he's not a kiss, she's just interested. The sound is level. Music, it is linked, philosophy. That is to say, many philosophers have spoken of the Gentile and the Elijah. There are many that we talk about music. Yes. Yes Yes Yes. And beyond Opontia, there are few who have spoken of painting. There are few, you think, I don't know. No I do not know. I don't know, I'm not sure. The music is off, you were talking about it, I was talking about it fast, I was talking about it. Yes, he spoke it well, he spoke cabbage well. Run, we talked. Who it takes neck? Yeah, he didn't talk much about the music. It was a secret with him. Yes, it was a secret. It's the part of the music, you have a secret. He had still been very close to musicians. Yes, yes, yes, he told me \u201cSocret\u201d all that. He didn't talk about it. Yes, but he was going to Bayreux, he was very close to my musical. He said &quot;Socret&quot; to me? Yes yes. Yes yes. Yes yes. And the berg exception, as Pierre Andr\xe9 breathes, which we passed through the Asse, why the clich\xe9? Where does this... it's part of it come to me, it's part of it too, and why and to see you in something? I do not know why. Because I discovered at the same time as the pieces for orchestra of... Oh, listen. You see what that, an old woman, not everything is comfortable. Than his master's orchestral pieces. From Games bergs. And I remember, to myself, not too long ago, I could put the pieces for orchestra. But 15 times in a row. And I knew my moms, the moms who upset me. And it's to himself, at the same time that I found berg, and he then made me him, I would have listened to him all day, yes, why? Me, I believe that you are also there, the question of the relationship with the earth. Unfortunately, I don't escape until much later. It's music and earth. Dip it again in the very old musicians, there was called me, the music and the earth. But that the music is understood from the earth to that extent, as she loved it, and I am unhappy. I found it upsetting, yes. Make sound, the mighty ones of the earth. It was his flip-flop for me. It was a great text because it is the music of the earth. It is a great work. He is from Crite, but very much the Crite-Marrie. Ah, the Crite-Marrie, for me the song is from Crite-Marrie. It is brought back between the song and the Crite, and one is fresh. All this school has surposed the problem. But the two seizures, I didn't get it from the Crite-Marrie. Horizontal Crite-Marrie that crushes the earth. In Vo\xefte-S\xe8que, and vertical Crite-Marrie. And the completely vertical Crite-Marrie of the contest. The dispute, the baroness, I no longer know. Contests it in Loulou. It's like two such top of Crite. But the relationship between... All that, that interests me too, if we also philosophize, there are songs and cries. Concepts are veritable songs in philosophy. And then there are cries of philosophy. There are cries of a course at Ristotte. We have to stop. Or to another who will say. No, I never stop. I don't know what maybe yet. We don't even know what maybe yet. That's screams. It's... Woe to port, cheating or affect concept. It's a bit the same. It's good for me. It's something that touches me.\",\"topics\":[\"opera\",\"music\",\"art\",\"aesthetics\",\"becoming\",\"affect\",\"concept\",\"territory\"],\"length\":17030,\"wordCount\":3083},{\"letter\":\"P\",\"title\":\"Professeur\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE -   P comme Professeur Part 1.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Professeur1.mp3\",\"content\":\"So P\xe9 is a teacher. Today you are 64 years old and for almost 40 years who was a teacher. First smoothed then at university and therefore this year the first or weeks are to be considered without classes. First, do the courses end? Because you also said that you did the lessons with passion. Do you miss not going to class today? So during the blow you don't feel the blow during the blow. No it's fine. It's true that it was my life in France. It was a part of my life, a very important part of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed teaching. But when the art came, it was a joy. Because I had less desire to teach. The question of courses is very simple. I think the courses are like... There are equivalents in other fields. But a course is something that requires a lot of preparation. I mean it fits the, almost the recipe for a lot of activities. If you want 5 minutes, 10 minutes at best of inspiration, you have to prepare a lot, a lot, a lot. To have that moment. If we haven't returned. So I could see more to go, I've always done that, I liked doing that. I was preparing a lot to have, but this is my hand of inspiration. And then the more to go, the longer I had to prepare for a more and more meager inspiration. It has been time. I didn't like it at all because the lessons are something I liked. Then something that I needed less. What I have left is to write, that it poses other problems, but I don't regret it at all. But I liked it, deeply, it's cool. For example when there is a lot prepared, how long was the preparation? We must think. That's how it is, it's rehearsals for a class. It repeats itself. It's like in the theatre, it's like in ditties. There are repetitions. If you haven't rehearsed a lot, you're not inspired at all. In real life, a course means moments of inspiration. Otherwise, it means nothing. Don't you rehearse in your mirror like that? I am not attractive to these modes of inspiration. But there are no automans who get into their heads and manage to find what they say interesting. It's obvious that if the gentleman who doesn't find what he says very interesting, it won't find you interesting, find passion. And there, it's not vanity, and it's not either finding yourself interesting, you have to find the subject you're dealing with, you have to find it fascinating. Sometimes you have to give yourself a real boost. In any case, it's not interesting, you have to get up, even to the point, where you are able to talk about something with enthusiasm. That's repetition. So I needed it less, and then the races are so special to cross. What is it a cube? It is a cube, that is to say, it is a space-time. And there's a lot going on in a class. I like conferences less. Me, never, but conferences, because conferences are too small a space-time. A course is something that extends, which extends from one week to another. It is a space. It is a very special temporality. It's a sequel. It's not at all that we can make up for what we would have been terrified of. But it is that there is an inner development going on. And then people, from one week to another, changes, all that is questions. The public of a course is something exciting. There, we will start at the beginning, who was first a high school teacher, you have good memories of high school. Yes, yes, because it doesn't mean anything. Because it's been a while in high school because he's become. I understand, I think the young teachers who are very downcast not in high school. Me, I was in high school, I was a high school teacher at the liberation, a moment of liberation, not long after. You are completely different. I am very teacher. I had two provincial towns. I liked a lot, one that I liked less. This you're friend that I liked very much, because it was a city of absolute freedom, a very free city, very... And then, linking that there is a city more, it's true . So, it was still the time when the professor of philosophy, he was received with great kindness. We forgave him a lot because you're a little crazy or the village idiot, for example, he could do whatever you want. Why... Me, I took my students to the so musical, because I did so musical. And everyone has to train normal. I think that now it would be more possible in high schools. And maybe I have how, it was to explain to them what, the musical si. When was that in your class? The curves, not that, yes, it's a thing, as you know, you have to bend it and you get the blood at one place on the curve. And it's moving curves that interest them a lot. It was already on the infinite variation. And this is where you say to yourself? No, but I wasn't just doing that. I was doing the program, I was doing a very conscious teacher. And that's where you met Pauprenes, I believe? Afterwards, yes, I got to know Pauprenes well, he did... But he, traveling more than me, there was very little left for better people. He had a small suitcase and he had a huge alarm clock. He didn't have the watches. And his first young was to take out his alarm clock. He was doing his lessons, with his big alarm clock. He was charming, yes. And who were you friends with in a high school teacher's room? Because when you're a student? Me, gymnastics. There, gymnastics. I'm really good here. Gym teachers, never many. At re-pission, we don't want to open up a very well anymore. The teachers' rooms, the high school, there too, that had to change. You got something. Imagine when you're still a student that the teachers' room is very heavy. It's mysterious and heavy. Oh no, no, it's time. There are all the people, there are the people on the go, there are the regular people. There are all the reasons. Must say, there are not many. Afterwards you made a mistake, were you a teacher at the grand ouch or a preparatory class? Yes yes. And there, you remember the remarkable work that you had and which did not give much? Ah, you haven't given much. Who didn't give much? I don't really know anymore. Yes, I remember them. They gave... But to my knowledge, they gave teachers. They didn't give... I never had lips that became ministers, that became... It's the people who became policemen. But no, nothing special, yes. They sell their ways, they are very good. And then afterwards, there were the Sorbonne years. And one has the impression that the years at the Sorbonne correspond to your years in the history of philosophy. And then, Vincent, Vincent who was a decisive experience after the Sorbonne. Finally, I jump because there was the ion in college. Yes Yes Yes. First of all, you were happy to go back to university after taking university, after taking iss\xe9e? What have we, that we have not espoutes like that at the level of a dare to your... It was a normal career, what. I will have come back... I had left the iss\xe9e, I will have come back to the liss\xe9e. Yes, I will be... I will not be dramatic, but it would have been normal, a failure, what, yes. It was normal, it was normal. Oh, no, there's no problem, there's nothing to say. But for example, the courses of faculty are differently prepared, precisely that the courses of iss\xe9e... Not for me, for at all. For you it was the same. Absolutely not, yes, I've always done the lessons the same way. The situation was as intense for smoothing it out as it was for faculty. Oh sure, sure. But in any case, you have to be... Absolutely, imbued with what you have. You have to like to hear yourself, talk, you need all that, you can't do all that. You have to repeat yourself in your head, you have to find the thing by which. We're going, that's even very amusing, you have to find. It's like... It's like a door you couldn't get through in the alposition part. So you prepared your classes exactly the same in high school and college. It was as prepared already in high school as it was later in college. In fact, for me, there was no difference in kind, and between the two kinds of courses. Yes the same. Since we are in your university course, you are going to tell us about your thesis. You passed it on account. Ah my thesis, I passed. I've done a lot of books before, I don't think I do. It is a frequent action. So, I work a lot, and then I say to myself, hey, I have to have my thesis, I have to do this, which is very hard. So, I pushed hard, and then finally, I presented it. I think I was promised the very first t\xe8zes after 68, which are meals. Didn't that do you? In 69, yes, it must be in 69, well, in fact in the first. So, if he gave me a very pre-emptive situation, because the jury only had one entity, it was like in fact to avoid the gangs, who were still wandering around the sorbonne. They had really, they were scared this esth, very start in your lap. But they said to themselves what is going to happen. And I remember that the president of the jury told me, there you go, there are two possibilities. Well, we do your thesis, to retouch, the sorbonne. And there is an advantage, it is that there are two exits. There is something we can say to each other and the jury. But only the inconvenience is that when editing, there are strips that hang around more willingly. So, well, we made it a first floor, so there's an advantage there. It is that the bands go up for a month frequently up to the first floor. But the inconvenience is that there is only one entrance, one exit. So, if there is something, how are we going to be a rocket scientist. So much so that when I passed my entrance, I was never able to meet the gaze of the president of the jury, who was fixed on the door. Who was it ? To find out if he was the bands. Come on, come on, yes. Who was your president of the jury? Ah, I do not know of this asceticism. I can take you out, I follow him... Plus, he was very charming. But he had more emotion than me, emotion, I think. It is rare that the jury is more moved than the candidate seen, it is only circumstances. You are not going to be exceptional. It was already almost more famous than three-quarters of the jury members of the past. No, I could salt you right now. Was it different at those rehearsals? Yes. Finally, you were already well known for your work. Yes yes. So we're going to move on to Vass\xe8ne, who was... Me, do you have something to say about Lyon after the Sorbonne? No no no no. Vass\xe8ne, vass\xe8ne, vass\xe8ne, it's almost there. Indeed, there is a change. You're right, it's not in the nature of preparation, of what I call rehearsal preparation for a course, nor in the style of a course. It's that, in fact, starting from Vass\xe8ne, I try to have a student audience. That was the splendor of Vass\xe8ne. The change of... It was not general in all the faculties. That, that, we were in order, but Vass\xe8ne remained, or in any case, in philosophy, it's not even true of all Vass\xe8ne, it was a public of a new type. A complete audience in a new type, which was more made up of students, which mixed all ages, people who came from very different activities, including psychiatric hospitals, like sick, who was the public, maybe, both the most variegated, and finding a mysterious unity in Vass\xe8ne. Both the most diverse and the most coherent, according to Vass\xe8ne, Vass\xe8ne gave this disparate people a unity. And for me, it's an audience. Then, I would have been no better, I did all my life as a teacher at Vass\xe8ne, but I would have been withdrawn from it for other faculties, I wouldn't even have recognized it. When I went to another faculty, afterwards, I had the impression of traveling back in time to fall back in full ten of messiac life. Before that, I spoke in front of people who were all mixed together, young painters, psychiatric treatment people, musicians, drugs, architect people, since very different, with waves, it varied from year to year, and I'm there who had a year when all of a sudden there were 5, 6 Australians who arrived, we don't know why, the Japanese were constant, the Japanese, every year, the South Americans, the blacks, all that was an invaluable public, a fantastic public. Because for the first time, that is to say, it's a fantastic audience. It was full philosophy which was addressed to philosophers just as much as one has to the philosopher. Exactly, as painting is addressed, it is to shepherds that we don't have. Or the music is not necessarily aimed at music specialists, and it's the same music. It's the same berg, or the same method, which is aimed at both people who are not music specialists and who are musicians. Philosophy must be for me, philosophy must be structurally the same. It is addressed as much to non-philosophers as to philosophers. It will change. Philosophy, when addressed to non-philosophers, does not mean that we are going to make it simple. It's no more than in music that we make things simpler for non-specialists. And there you have it, philosophy speaks. Exactly the same. For me, philosophy has always had a double audition, a non-philosophical audition, as much as a philosophical audition and if there was talk of the liver, that's why philosophy wouldn't mean anything otherwise. Now, explain to me a finesse in lectures. There are non-philosophers and yet you are the lectures. I go to conferences because it's artificial, because it's artificial, it is, and then because of the before and the after. Finally, as much as I love racing, which is a manner of speaking, as much as I will talk. Speaking could really be an activity of... So conferences, speaking before, speaking after, etc. It's not at all the purity of a course. And then the conference, the conference. It's a circus side, the course too, it's a circus side. But it's a circus at least that makes me laugh and that is deeper. There, there is an artifice side, the conference, people go there, they are cold, I don't really know but, the fact that I don't go to conferences. Well, I'm not going to lecture. It's too tense, too p*****, too cheeky, too chebanc. It doesn't seem very interesting and conference to me.\",\"topics\":[\"teaching\",\"professor\",\"education\",\"transmission\",\"desire\",\"difference\",\"philosophy\",\"joy\"],\"length\":14311,\"wordCount\":2597},{\"letter\":\"P\",\"title\":\"Professeur\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE -   P comme Professeur Part 2.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Professeur2.mp3\",\"content\":\"Here we are going to come back to your dear Vassane audience who was very mixed, but me in those Vassane years when there were crazy people, drugs as you said, as you said, who made wild interventions , who spoke, never, never, it didn't seem to bother you. All the interventions were in the middle of your course which remained masterful and no intervention for you had value of objection. That is to say that there was always this masterful aspect of your course. It would be necessary to invent a different way, it is the world which imposes on itself an inverse citema, a lecture course. One might need another way, that is to say, there are two conceptions of a course, I believe. A design after which a course aims to obtain reactions to these immediate from an audience, this form of question, need for interruption, it is a whole current, it is a whole design of a course. And then on the contrary, the so-called masterful conception, there is the gentleman who speaks. Me, I've always had, I don't know that I prefer Noulou, I have no choice. Me, I've only ever remembered the second, the so-called masterful conception. So, we would have to find, I say a different way, because the limit is more a musical conception of a lesson. For me, a course, you don't interrupt the music, whether it will be good or my bladder. Or else, we interrupt her if she's too my vese. But we don't interrupt music, as long as we can very well, we don't interrupt words. So, what does a musical conception of a lesson mean? I believe two things. Finally, in my experience, without at all saying that it is this design that is the best. I say mine as I see things, as I know myself, an audience, or what my audience has been. I tell myself, it always happens that someone does not understand at the time. And then there are what should be called delayed effects. The other too, it's a bit like in music. At the time, you don't understand a movement. And then, three minutes later, it comes from a pite, or 10 minutes later. Because it's not a maintenance thing. The delayed effects of a course, a little very well in understanding nothing at the time. 10 minutes later, it lights up. There is a retractive effect. If the interrupter is already prostrate enough, I find the interupions, or even the questions that can be asked, amazing to me. You ask a question because you're not understanding, but you just have to wait. So, these interruptions, you thought they were stupid because we didn't wait? Yes, because... There's that, there's this first aspect. What someone does not understand. Although possible, he is the understands after all alone. I find the best students are the ones who ask questions the week after. I had a system at the end, I didn't unless he had invented it, sometimes he would pass me a little note from one week to the next. Never much. I was told, we must come back to this point. But they had waited, we have to come back to this point, I didn't, it didn't matter, but there was this communication. And then, the second very important point, in a course as I see it, for me, it was courses that lasted 2 hours, no one can listen to someone for 2 hours. So, for me, a course has always been something that is not meant to be understood in its entirety. A lesson was Mathieu's spirit in motion, it was really a Mathieu in motion. And that's where it's musical. And in which each, or each group, or each student, limits it, takes what suits him the wrong way, it is something which, literally, suits no one. But we cannot say that everything is suitable for everyone. So people have to wait, almost at the limit, it was obvious that some of them slept halfway. And then by what mystery wakes up at the moment that he is conserving. There is no law saying in advance, this will concern such and such, it's not even the subjects that interest them in anything else. A lesson is emotion. It's so many emotions of intelligence, there are no emotions, there is nothing, there is no interest. So it's a question of following everything, even listening to everything. It's about waking up, waiting to grab what suits you, what suits you personally. And that's why he published very varied and very very important. Because we train well, there are intelligent places that jump from one to another. And that forms a kind of splendid fabric, of texture, of texture. There, yes, that's it. So that's the audience, but for this concert, precisely, you invented the word pop philosophy and pop philosophers. Yes, that's what she meant. Yes, but we can say that your look like that of Foucault was something very special. And I mean your hat, your nails, your voice. Are you aware that... There was a kind of mitification of the students of this pace. As, moreover, they mitigated Foucault as they mitigated Val's voice. Do you think you have to have a look and then a particular voice? Oh yeah, sure, that. Certainly, since the voice in a course, but if philosophy, as we said, we have already talked about it, it seems to me a little bit, philosophy is mobilized, it deals with concepts. With there is a vocalization of concepts in a course, yes, that's normal. Just as there is a style of the concepts seems to be written, the philosophy is not already written. Without research, without developing a style, it's like artists, it's artists. Well, a class involves vocalizations, yes. It implies, yes, let's go, it even implies. I don't know the almane kind of cheerful spraise. Well yes, that, of course, of course. While there are myths about it, we had these nails, that's part of all the problems, but already in primary school, it's like that. But what is more important is the relationship between the voice and the concept, it is the relationship, yes. Me, you have to please all the same, you chappouses, you are when the little black dress of pien, there was a very precise pace. Yes, finally, my art, it is that I did not put for that. So if it produces this effect, we'll be fine, very good, very good. It's part of the role of the teacher. Is this part of the teacher's role? No, that's not part of the teacher's role. It's a supplement. If it's part of the role of the teacher, that's what I said about pre-rehearsal and in-the-moment inspiration. It is a role of the teacher. You never wanted school or here. It corresponds to something very deep in you, this refusal of the disciples. Yes, I refused, I think, it generally still makes your fu, it's that it makes both sides, no one wants to be a good disciple. Me, I don't want to have it. A school is terrible for the very ground reasons. A school takes a long time. We come to manage. For philosophers who make school. Whatever the lives of Gens\xe9nia, it's a school. Good, it's not the marade. Les Aides-Gaviens is a school. First of all, it involves terrible settling of accounts, it involves exclusivities, it involves an organization of time. It involves a whole management, I have a school. Me, I attended between the rivalries, between the Aides-Gaviens, France, and in Man\xe9-Parbau, and the Aides-Gaviens-Bel, I have some velances, such at the utro-knife. All that is abominable, at least for me, it introduces us. There is a field. And then, I have other, I mean, even at the level of ambitions, to be... Yeah, to be a school head, to see the camp, the camp, the camp, it's a head of school too. But it's terrible, it gives a lot of worries. You have to be made up at V\xe9lic, to be all that, and then, I hate it, for my project, I hate it. It's school, it's the opposite of movement. It's... I'll take a very simple example, surrealism, it's a school. Settlement of the account, court, exclusion, etc., Breton, he made a school. D'ardat was a movement. Me, me too, I had an ideal, I'm not saying that I succeeded, it would be to participate in a movement. That, yes, being in a movement, yes. But even being the head of a school seems to me... it doesn't seem at all inspiring, viable. So... A movement where the ideal is finally. If you want, it's not to have notions, to guarantee and sign, or that the tenis prep\xe8tes, for me, there are two important things. The relationship one can have with students is... Learning them again that they should make them happy with their loneliness. They don't arrive... They don't arrive without heroes, a little communication, without soil, etc., that's why they want schools. But... They won't be able to do anything but their loneliness. So it's teaching them the good of their loneliness. It's reconciling them with their loneliness, then you have to... That, then that, that, that's my role as a teacher. And then, the second aspect, but it's more or less the same, I don't want to launch notions that they make schools, I would like to launch notions of concepts that pass through the course, which become, not at all, I want not to say, which become something ordinary, but which become current ideas, that is to say manageable in several ways. So that can only happen if I also address solitary people who will twist notions in their own way, without serving as they need. So all that is notions of movement and not notions of school. And do you think that the university today the era of the great professors has revolutionized, it doesn't seem to be going very strong as a university? Me, I don't have much idea about it, but I left, a moment that was terrifying, I didn't understand how the teachers could still make moves. That means, they had become managers. The university is current and very clear policy. And the capacity will be to be a place of orchestra. It is one with the coming into force of discipline which has nothing to do with university disciplines. My dream would be for universities to remain places of research and that alongside universities there would be more schools. During technical schools, we learn accounting, we learn computer science, etc. But the university even intervenes in computer science in accounting only at the level of research. And there would be agreements, all the agreements you want between a school and a university. The school, seeing these students, pursues orchestra lessons, yes. But as soon as we bring school subjects, university and the damned into the university, it's more a place of orchestra. And one is increasingly eaten by management stories, the number of meetings, etc., etc., university. That's why I don't quite see how teachers can't give a course. So I guess, I guess they all do the same, or they don't even anymore. But maybe I'm wrong, maybe they keep doing great. But finally, the expectation seems to me to be the disposition of the research of the university, the rise of the non-creative disciplines in the university, not of which are not research disciplines. They call me russas. The adaptation of the university to the labor market. But it's not the role of the university, it wasn't in the job market, it's the role of the schools.\",\"topics\":[\"teaching\",\"professor\",\"education\",\"transmission\",\"concept\",\"philosophy\",\"thought\"],\"length\":11259,\"wordCount\":1966},{\"letter\":\"Q\",\"title\":\"Question\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE -  Q comme Question.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Question.mp3\",\"content\":\"2nd plaha. It is really good. So what is it? Philosophy rested questions, problems and the questions were fabricated. And as you say, the goal does not wait to answer that to get out of these questions. So for example, leaving the history of philosophy was creating new questions for you. But here, in an interview, we don't ask questions, it's not really questions. So how am I gonna get through this and how are you gonna get through this? What do we do ? Finally, the forced choice? First, what is the difference between a question, in the media and a question in philosophy, to start at the beginning? It's difficult because at the... I say, it's more difficult because we have... In the media, most of the time, or in the conversation to get back, let's say, there is no question, there is no problem. There are questions. If I say how are you, it's not a problem. Even if you are bad. If I say she would have been, that's not a problem. All that is questions, we wonder. If you watch the level of regular television, even in very serious broadcasts, these are questions. What do you think of this? This is not a problem. It's a question, it's a question, it's your opinion. Well, no. That's why TV isn't very interesting. This is the opinion of the jambas. It doesn't seem to me to have a very fraternal life. If we say, do you believe in God? It is a question. Where is the problem, is the question no question? So much more if we ask questions or questions, yes, yes. If we ask questions or problems. In a TV show, it will indeed be necessary, it is cerenic, yes, okay. But that doesn't happen often. It doesn't go often. Political broadcasts don't include any acknowledgment that we have no problem. One could, one could say, for example, in legs, but how does the question chie-boise suppose? No one will come to me from the specialists of China. Who tell us about China, currently, things that we could have said all that, without knowing a word about China. It's not so much. It's a computer's empathy at all. I go back to my example because big gods, hey, gods. What is God's problem or question? It's because you believe in God or not, if you don't have such a space for many people. And what does that mean? When we say the word &quot;God&quot;, what does it mean? What does it mean ? So I imagine the questions. It could mean, are you going to be judged after you die? How is that a problem? Because it removed a problematic relationship between God and the moment of judgment. Is God a judge? It's a question. And then, then, I guess we are told not to scale. Yes, not scale. He wrote a famous text. It's Paris. Does God exist or does God not exist? We bet. And then, we say the text not scale. We realize that it is absolutely not about that. For what ? Because that's another question he asks. The question of not scale, it is not that God exists or does God not exist? What is finally a question, here too, not very interesting, is that it is the best mode of existence. The mode of existence the one who believes that God exists, or the mode of existence the one who believes that God does not exist. It is good that the question of not scale, it absolutely does not concern the existence of God, or the non-existence of God. The existence of the one who believes that God does not exist, for reasons that the development is his own, but who are very disciples, he thinks that the one who believes that God exists has a better existence than the one who believes that God does not exist. It's his business. This is making it Pascalian. There, there is a problem and there is a question. It is already no longer God's question. There is an underlying history of questions and transformations of vegetable questions into others. Similarly, when it says God is dead, it does not mean the same thing that God does not exist. So I can say, if I say God is dead, what question does that refer to, which is not the same as when I say God does not exist. And then, in his perspective, if it is innate that God does not exist, God is absolutely not dead. And that's another question that comes through there. Namely that if God is dead, there is no reason that man also is not dead. It is therefore necessary to find something other than man, etc. What interests him is not that God is dead, it is that he interests, it is the future of something other than man. All that is the art of questions and problems. So me, I think it can be done on my television, but or in the media. But it will make for a very special type of show. This is what is under-assessing problems and questions. Whereas with so well in the conversation grante, that in the media, one remains within level of the interrogations. I don't know where to quote. Yes, it's not all that. Their truth is really questions. Their Madame Veille, do you believe in Europe before? All right. What's to come for Europe? What is interesting is good. What is Europe's problem? Europe's problem? I will say it all. Because that way, for once, I would have a present. It's the same as China now. He thinks all this prepares Europe to standardize Europe and wonders about it. As we are going to standardize insurance, etc. And then there will be a Place de la Concorde 1 million children from all over Oldalmania, etc. And he dominates in Paul Drug, he dominates in Paul. Their very well. To care there, it frank to say specialists for recourses to the explained who were the Oldal in places of the Concorde. Ah well, it's over, we did the a\xe9, etc. Well, they missed the questions. At the time when it was necessary to pose them, one made a little confused all that well. For example, you think in years you have read a daily newspaper and it seems to me that you read more daily the world or liberation. There is something in the level of the press and the media precisely not to ask these questions. Oh well I feel like I don't know. Who disgusts him? Ah yes, it's all ready. We have the feeling of learning less and less. Ah, no I have everything ready, I would like to learn stuff in serien. We don't know at all, we don't know how the newspapers tell us anything, either, I don't really know. But you, watching the news every day, then... Fifth! The air of the oppu, the time that it is 4\xb0, it is only the hand. Go ahead, clear. But you, for example, each time you watch the television news since it's the only program you never miss, you have an unspoken question each time, which is not formulated, which is forgotten by the media. Ah, I don't know tonight. I don't know. But you rather feel that we never forgot what? The questions, I believe, to the limit that we could not ask them. If you take the very old story, we can't ask the questions, the story, I take a very recent story. We stop everything old. Why now ? So everyone says, why was he protected? But everyone, it's good that there must be stories. He was an intelligence chief. He must have information on the conduct of Church netary audits during the war, all that. Everyone knows that the corner is aware, but the agreed do not make up the questions and that we will not marry. This is called consensus. It is convenience, convention, after which questions and problems will be replaced by questions. Questions like, how are you? That is to say... Ah, such a convent, the hidden one... Why? Everyone knows that's not the issue. Everyone knows. Everyone knows. So I'll take another example, it's between right-hand renemvators and right-hand devices. Everyone knows what it is. The newspapers tell us that we don't tell love. I don't know, I say it like that, it's obvious to me that between the renemvateurs on the right, there is a very interesting problem. It's summer, it's not who is particularly young, their young is... It consists of this, it's an attempt by the right, to shake up the party apparatuses which are still centralized apparatuses on Paris. The independence of the regions goes to him. It's very interesting, it's quite interesting. But nobody like this on this aspect and their connection to Europe, which wants to do it, not a Europe of Nations, it wants to do it a Europe of regions. He wants true unity to be regional and inter-regional, not national and inter-national. That's a problem. And the socialists in Ortou, they will have this problem between regionalist tendencies and tendencies. But the party apparatuses, the provincial federations in the unions, in the party stuff, in the federations. If still via he was handling, namely, it goes back to Paris and the weight, he is very centralized. Right-wing renemvateurs, it's an anti-Jacobin moment. That the left will also have that. So, I say to myself, in fact, we should make them talk about it, but they won't say it, they refuse to talk about it. They refuse to talk about it, because at that moment, they discover themselves. They will only ever answer questions, for questions, it's nothing, it's conversation, it's of no interest. The conversation, that, never had the discussions, that, no interest. TV, except exceptionally, the fights of discussion, the interrogations, all that. But it's nothing. It's not even that it hears me, it's so difficult. At Canaderet. Me, I'm less optimistic than you, me, I have the impression that there is a saint clair who, in the consensus, she doesn't notice it, she thinks she's asking good questions, she doesn't is not at all in the intergacon. Oh yeah, but that's his business. I'm sure she's very happy, she's yes, yes, yes. That's for sure, but that's his business. You never agree to go on television. We have to try to hell, if we would stay in the bay, to go on television? Why don't you want to be on television for all these reasons? As proof, here I go. But my reason won't go through with it, it has to be exactly what I just said. Me, I have no desire to have conversations, discussions with people. I don't follow the questions. That doesn't interest me. And the discussions, I'm not in relation to what I'm discussed about things. When no one knows what problem it is. If it lives on inex\xe9page, I resume my story of God. What is a question of an existence of God, of the death of God, of the death of man, of the existence of God, of the existence of the one who believes in God, etc., is a boil is very tiring. So everyone in turn, everyone spoke about all that. But it's domesticity, it's tapure, plus a bullshit presenter, but pity, pity. The main fact is that you are here today to answer our little questions.

As you said in a recent lecture at la f\xe9mise, philosophy creates concepts and as soon as we create, as you said in this lecture, we resist. So artists, filmmakers, musicians, mathematicians, philosophers, all these people resist. But resist what exactly? First we will take philosophy by case, it creates concepts, but science, it creates concepts, does it? No, these are standing questions because if we agree, if we agree to reserve the word concept for philosophy, we go to scientific notions, scientific ideas, they must be designated by another word. We don't say of an artist either who creates concepts, a shepherd, a musician creates by concepts, he creates something else so for science you have to be open to other words. But it looks like for example a savant and someone who creates functions. But we, I'm not saying that's the best word, it creates functions but functions are created as much. We take the creation of new functions, Einstein, Galois, the great mathematicians but not only the mathematicians, the biologists who create functions. Well, what are these sacred resistances, these resistances, all that? It's clearer for the arts because science is in a more disgusting position and a bit like the cinema, the grips of such a problem of program, of capital, all that the parres of resistance, but finally, the great savants, it is all the same also great resistance fighters. We think of Einstein, of many physicists, of many biologists today, that's obvious. It first resists the practices and views of current opinion, that is to say all areas of questioning to a pessil, they demand their, they really have the strength to demand their critmain. We won't age them, an important thing in premature conditions, all that, it's up to all how bouchiculeera not an artist, nobody on the right bouchicule, an artist. But I believe that all that is because the created has resisted itself, it is because I, I believe that I am going to tell you and there is another that I stuck his hand in, who will do me a lot in Stegard is that I believe that one of the motives of art and thought is a certain shame of being a man. I believe that the man who said it, the artist, the writer who said it most profoundly was primon les vies. He knew how to talk about his theonde of being a man and him, he did an extremely deep level since it is following his turn of the great exterminations, he will be with it, he says, yes, I have been liberated, what dominated was the shame of being a man. So, it's a phrase that's both very splendid, I believe very beautiful and then, perhaps, it's not abstract, it's very, very concrete, the shame of being a man. But she doesn't want to say, the nonsense in resolving, that doesn't mean, we are all, that, that, you don't know how to say, we are all, it's guilty, for example, we are all, it's in front of the Nazism. Prima au l\xe9vil, he says it admirably, he says, that doesn't mean that electable bullies are the same, that, we're not yet open to that. There are many people who tell us, yes, we are all guilty and no, no, nothing at all. We won't confuse the elavictim stuffer, that. So the shame of being a man doesn't mean we're all the same, we're all compromised, etc. But that means, I believe several things, it's a complex feeling, it's not a unified feeling. There, we are all as men, that means at the same time, how could men have done that, men, that is to say other than me. How could they do this? And secondly, how did I still make a deal, I didn't become a bully, but I still made a deal enough to survive. And then, a certain shame, precisely, to have survived in the place of certain friends who themselves are not surviving, all that. It is therefore an extremely composite feeling, the shame of being a man. Me, I believe that at the base of art, there is this idea that, where this very strong feeling, a certain shame of being a man who makes that art, its grossista, freed the life that the man imprisoned. Man does not stop imprisoning life, does not stop killing life. The shame of being a man, the artist is the one who releases a powerful life, a more than personal life. It's not his life. How do I get back to you on the artist and resistance? That is to say that this share of shame in being a man, art liberates, life in this prison, in this prison of shame, is very different from sublimation. Finally, the art is not at all, it is really a story. Oh no, it is. It's a release of life, it's a liberation, life. What is that ? And there, it is not at all abstract things. What's a great novel character? A great character from a novel is not a character borrowed from the real and even inflated. Charlu, it's not mounted what, it's not mounted what, even inflated by the brilliant imagination of proustes. It's fantastic life powers. It's fantastic life powers, so bad it turns out. A character from a novel, he has integrated into himself. Limbs, he's a kind of giant. It's an exaggeration in relation to life, but it's not an exaggeration in relation to art. There he is producing these exaggerations. And it is through their existence soil, it is already resistance. Or, as we said, we join our first theme, ah! Ecrique is always writing for animals. That is to say, not their intention, but in their place, it's that fresh animals aren't, it's going to rewrite, right? Liberate life. Liberating life is prisons that man... And that's resisting, that's resisting, it's not... We can see it with artists, I'll say it step by step. There is no art that is not a release of a power of life. There is no art of death first. There is no art, is not enough, after my advice, he ended up committing suicide. Alright, alright, so afterwards, he committed suicide personally. Yeah, he couldn't hold it. He committed suicide in his personal life. There are four pages or soft pages or no primolevial pages that remain in termin. It will remain in resistance and eternal. What happened, there is a trick. And so much more, I'm talking about the wonder of being a man. It's not even in the grand sense of the top of primol\xe9vies, you understand. Because if we don't dare say something like that, but each of us, in our daily life, there are tiny events that inspire us with the wonder of being a man. We are witnessing a scene where someone really is a little too vulgar. We're not going to make a scene. We are embarrassed. We are embarrassed for him. One is embarrassed for oneself, since one seems to me to support it, almost. There too, we make a kind of compromise. And if we protest by saying, but it's in\xe9op, what you say, we violate a drama. We are trapped. We are, we are provelas. It can't be compared with Rojuit. But even at this tiny level, there's a little shame in being a man. If we do not prove this shame, there is no reason to make art. It's not long things. But when you crib certainly when you have an artist, you feel, it's danger, all the time. And danger that surrounds, there are dangers everywhere. Of course. Yes. In philosophy too, that's what Nutsch said, a philosophy that doesn't harm stupidity, doesn't harm stupidity, resists stupidity. But if there was no philosophy, it must be as if philosophy was pretious and good for conversations to apprehend. But if there was no philosophy, we would not suspect the level of stupidity. Philosophy prevents stupidity from being as great as it would be if there were no philosophy. It is its splendour. We do not wonder what it would be. Just as if there weren't the arts but the vulgarity of people. So when we say, it's resisting, it's resisting, it's actually, I mean, the world wouldn't be skilled, if there wasn't art. That, people, they would hold out longer. They don't have that they read philosophy, but it's its only existence that keeps people from being as stupid and stupid as they would be if it appears. And you, for example, when we announce the death of thought, you know that there are people who love the death of thought, the death of cinema, the death of literature. It's to make people laugh. There is no death, there are assassinations. It is very simple. Maybe we have assassinations in the cinema, that's possible. But there is no natural death. For a simple reason, until something holds up and takes over the function of philosophy, philosophy will have every right to exist. And if something else takes on the function of philosophy, I don't see anything growing out of it other than philosophy. If we say, for example, philosophy, it consists in creating concepts and thereby harming stupidity, preventing stupidity. Why do you want philosophy to die? We can prevent it, we can censor it, we can secure it. But it has a function. She's not going to die. My death from philosophy still doesn't give me an idea, but a stupid one, what an idiotic idea. It's a widower that I don't want to air. I'm very happy that she's not dying, but I even understand because that means the death of philosophy. It seems to me, it seemed to me a little stupid, how nice, to say something. To say things have changed, a few reasons. But what will replace philosophy? What will create concepts? So you can tell me we need to create more concepts. Oh yes, and stupidity rules. Fine, it's the idiots who... Well, they want the skin of philosophy, fine. But what will create concepts? It's the computer, it's the ads, they probably have a concept. Very well, well we will have the advertising concepts, it is the concept of a brand of noodles. It's not likely to cause much rivalry with philosophy, because I don't think the word concept is used in the same way. But today, it is rather advertising that presents itself as the direct rival of philosophy, then it is an oversight. We invent the concepts. But the concepts of computing, the concepts of computers, it's rather funny, what they call a concept. Yes, we don't have to do that again. Can we say that you, Felix Foucault, form networks of concepts like networks of resistance, like a war machine, against a dominant thought of commonplaces? It would be good, if it were true, it would be very good. In any case, the network is surely the only one... If we do it through schools, and schools, that doesn't seem very, very good to me, like once. If we don't want schools, there's only the system of networks, complicity,... Of course, that's always been like that, moreover, all the times. What is called romanticism, for example, what is called German romanticism or general romanticism, is a network, what is called Dadaism is a network, whereas there are networks today. I'm sure, yes. The resistance zone. By this very fact, the function of the network is to resist, yes, to be created, yes. And you, do you feel, for example, famous and clandestine, this notion of clandestinity, clandian? I don't insist, I don't smell famous. I do not feel clandestine, I would indeed like to be imperceptible. It was... But there are a lot of people who would like, who want to be imperceptible, they couldn't say that I wasn't. But being imperceptive is good because... We can... Yes, but those are questions, so almost personal, what I want, what I want is to do my job. It's that we don't fool around, that we don't waste time, yes. At the same time seeing people, because I need to, I'm like everyone else, I like people. Finally, I like a small number of people, I like to see them. But when I see them, I don't see that that makes hand in hand the problem, what, imperceptible relationships, imperceptible people, that's what has bigger people, what. I mean, we're all molecules, what, it's a network molecule to molecular network, what, yes. Is there a strategy of philosophy? For example, when you are writing about A\xefbnitz this year, is it strategically that you are writing about A\xefbnitz now? I guess it depends on a strategy, that means, we don't write in a certain necessity. If there is no need to make a book, that is to say no need felt by the one he is doing, well it is better that he not do it. So when I wrote about A\xefbnitz, it's because for me it requires you. And why do you need it? Because you came for me, mummy, that would be explained to everyone, not by the teeth of the A\xefbnitz, but of the fold. And that the fold, bah, it happened that for me, it has the fundamental missed at the A\xefbnitz. But that, I could say of each book that we did, that we were the necessity at the time. No, but apart from the flu of necessity that pushes you to write, that is to say the return to a philosopher, like from the history of philosophy, after the book on cinema, where books like him plaitent or the whole said, is that in this land... There was no return to a philosopher, that's why I answered your question correctly. I didn't write a book on the A\xefbnitz, I only wrote a book on the A\xefbnitz, because for me the mum came to study what a trick is to you. I write the history of philosophy when I need to, that is to say, when I encounter, and prove in it, a notion which is itself already linked to a philosopher. When I became passionate about the notion of expression, I wrote a book on this pinoza, because this pinoza is a philosopher who has taken the notion of expression to an extremely high point. When I came across the notion of fold on my own, it seemed to me helpful either that it would be through the A\xefbnitz, that the marie would have encountered notions that are not already dedicated to philosophy. I won't do the history of philosophy, but for me there is no difference between writing a history of philosophy book and writing a philosophy book. So it's a sense that I say I had my way.\",\"topics\":[\"resistance\",\"power\",\"politics\",\"struggle\",\"difference\",\"body\",\"concept\",\"machine\"],\"length\":14073,\"wordCount\":2499},{\"letter\":\"S\",\"title\":\"Style\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE  - S comme Style  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Style.mp3\",\"content\":\"So is it this style? Oh no, well there. So, what is Andiologue's style? You say it's the property of those who are said to have no style. I think you say it about Balsac, I seem to remember. So what is a style? Ah well, it's not a small question, are you ok? No, that's why it's asked so quickly. Yeah, and what do you see? I tell myself this. To understand what a style is, one must above all know nothing of linguistics. Linguistics has done a lot of harm. Why does she hurt so much? Because there is opposition. There, Foucault, it will be said very well. There is an opposition, it is even their complementarity, between linguistics and literature. Against the mention of that, it doesn't count at all. For linguistics, a language is always a system in equilibrium. So, of which we can make the science. And the rest, the variations, they are put on the side, not of language, but of speech. When we write, we know well that a language is in fact a system, physicists would say, a system by nature far from equilibrium. It is a system in perpetual equilibrium. So there is no difference, or there is no difference in level between the angue words, but the language is made of all kinds of currents and therogens in balances with each other . So what is the style of a great author. Personally, I believe that style, there are two things in a style. You see, there, I answer clearly. Claire is fast, a big shame, it's too high. A style, it seems to me, consists of two things. We subject the language in which we spoke, we write. You put your tongue through some treatment. Not an artificial, voluntary treatment, etc., it is a treatment that mobilizes everything. The will of the author, but also his desires, his desires, his series. It is necessary, it is necessary. Finally, to submit to the language a treatment, its tactic, original. It can be, then, but your, we find the theme of the animal, it can make the tongue wail. I mean not babble yourself, make the tongue babble. Or what is not the same thing, stammering the tongue, for examples of great stylists. Derrasime Luca Poet, I say basically, he makes yawn, not his own word, he makes the language yawn. P\xe9gui, it's curious people, because p\xe9gui has a certain personality, a certain type, we forget that above all and, like all great artists, he's a complex madman. No one has ever written like pegui, no one will ever write like pegui again. It is part of the great styles of the French language, that is to say of the great creatures of the French language. What makes him, you can't say he's a beagle? It makes the sentence grow in the middle, it's fantastic. Instead of sweating sentences, it repeats the same sentence with an addition in the middle of the sentence. Which in turn will engender another tradition in the sentence, etc. It is a process of proliferating the sentence from the middle, by insertion. It's a great disgust, it's a great style. So that's the first aspect. Putting the tongue through treatment, but incredible treatment. That's why a great style is not a preservation of syntax. It is a syntax creator. And I do not come out of the post so beautiful formula. Chedoves are always written in some sort of foreign language. A style is someone who creates a foreign language in his language. It's true of s'\xe9line, it's true of p\xe9gui, it's true of... That's what you recognize as a stylist. And secondly, along with the first aspect, namely, the syntax is subjected to a contentious, but necessary distorting treatment. Which constitutes like a foreign language in the language in which one writes, at the same time, the second prince is only by the same, or this time, everything engages him, up to a kind of limit. The limit that, the edge that separates from the music, a kind of music is produced. If we succeeded in things there, and if there is a need to do so, it's a style, that's the \xe9gan styleiste. And it's true of everyone at the same time, we're also going to pose a foreign language in language and bring all language to a kind of musical limit. That's to see a style. And you, do you think you have a style? Wow Fidi. But I have a month, I can say, that he has changed from the first books now. He is like Saint-V\xe9rifilm. And generally, we are going towards more and more without burning. But the darker and darker does not mean the less complex. I think of the administration of cold style, it's Keroak. Keroak at the end, Keroak, it's a Japanese line. It's really a Japanese design, a pure Japanese line, his style. That, that we had a sobriety, but which then implies a creation, really the creation of a foreign language in the language, all the more so, yes. So, a style, I'm thinking of Selino too, it's very very very hard, when people still say to Selino, you have introduced the spoken language into the written language, which was already stupidity. In fact, it takes quite a treatment written in the language. It is necessary to create a foreign language in the language and to hold in writing the equivalent of speaking. He has too much polt to speak in the language, it's stupidity. But when you compliment him on that, it's very good that he's at... and that he's so far from what would like. And that's going to be in the second novel, in Mora Cr\xe9dit, that's it. In Mora Credit, that he will approach. But when Mora Credit is told, he must be changing, but he knows again that he is very, very far from what he wants. And what he wants, he's going to get it with Gignal's Band, where we've made the language and pushed it to such a limit that it's all music project. It's more a treatment of the language that makes the anguette dangerex, it's all the language pushed to a musical limit. While a style, by nature, changes, and sabaritation. And that's when we say to him, to this repetitive music with... Yes, except that P\xe9gu is a greater stylist. You didn't answer my perfilie, do you think you have a style? I would like, to what I say, I would like, I have the feeling, if we already say to be a styleist, we have to live the problem of style, I can answer more modestly, if it is a style, for me, I screw him, yes. I had the flu, telling myself the style, we'll see later. I know very well that I won't get the movement of the concepts that I want, if it doesn't go through the style. And the need to compete it, I know close, we redo the same page 10 times. 8. So style is like a necessity of composition, of what you're writing, and composition intervenes in a very primordial way. There, I believe that you are completely right, it is something else that you say there. Is the composition of a book already done in style? There, I believe that absolutely, yes. The composition of a book is one thing... it is decided beforehand, it is done at the same time as the book is being made. For example, in books that... in what I've done, if I dare invoke that, there are books that seem composed to me. I have always attached importance to the composition itself. I am thinking, for example, of a book called Logique du Sense, which is composed by series. It's really a kind of serial composition for me. And then, il plato, platoes being things. But, for me, it's two almost musical compositions. Yes. A composition is an element of the fundamental style. Yes. And in your expression, to use a sentence you said earlier, do you... Now, today, you are closer to what you wanted to do, than 20 years, or it doesn't happen like that, or it's... You have the same thing I do, I feel like I'm getting closer. In what is not part of the game, in what is not yet done, I have the feeling that I am approaching, that I am holding something, that I am looking for and that I had not found. Yes. And style isn't just about air, you're sensitive in all areas. For example, you live with faded elegance, and your friend Jean-Pierre is very elegant. If you are very sensitive to this elegance. Yes, there, I like that to overtake by them. I would like to be very elegant, but I know well that I am not. But elegance for me is one thing... Even perceiving it, I mean, there is already an elegance which consists in perceiving what elegance is, this one, there are people who pass by. And for whom, for example, what is called elegance is not elegance at all. So, a certain seizure of elegance, there is already part of elegance, that strikes me a lot. It's also a field, it's like everything, it can be learned. You have to be a little gifted, it has to be learned. Why are you telling me this ? For style, who is from all areas? Ah, the genre, well yes, of course, but in fact, it weighs on you, it's still not too late. Which is maybe what it takes. No no. Is it true? I don't know, it's just... I have the feeling, it's more, it doesn't just depend on the elegance, that there's one thing that I admire a lot, but this that's important in the world, that's all my elegance. So, I was going to say, the dance of elegance, vulgarity too, it is my elegance. It's more that, if it matters to me. It is the emission of signs. So, no doubt that's why I was loved, that I still love proust so much, worldliness, worldliness, worldly relations, these are emissions of fantastic signs. What is called a blunder is a misunderstanding in a sign. You know, signs that people don't understand. So, that's... But worldliness, as the medium of coldness of signs, empty, absolutely empty, no interest in these signs. But that is the avoidance of the nature of forgiveness. It joins the animal members, because the animal members too. It's fantastic sign shows. The animals and the mondas are the masters of the signs. Besides, you don't go out much, but you've always been more sensitive to the evening and worldly than any sensation we experience viale. Ah, well yes, because... At least the constituent circles don't argue. They spent vulgarity there. And the conversation is absolutely in lightness, that is to say in evocation, which would be really fast, in conversational speed, whatever you have. Here too, these are very interesting sign emissions.\",\"topics\":[\"style\",\"writing\",\"expression\",\"singularity\",\"desire\",\"difference\",\"concept\"],\"length\":10352,\"wordCount\":1853},{\"letter\":\"T\",\"title\":\"Tennis\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE -  T comme Tennis.m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Tennis.mp3\",\"content\":\"So you've always been this tennis player? Tennis. You have always loved tennis. A famous anecdote where as a child was chased away from our graph, with a great player it's black and you realized that it was the king of Sweden who finally asked you for our graph. No, I had that all the same, he really bothered you with people. He got you, he had a whole bodyguard. Yeah yeah yeah. That I had been asked in our graph to the King of Sweden, yes. Le Figaro had photographed me at the time, there is a photo in Le Figaro where there is a little boy who asks our graph to the old king of Sweden, it's me. And it was that great Swedish player that you could hunt? No, it's my retirement. It was not a great Swedish player, it was my retiree who was the main bodyguard of the king of Sweden since he played tennis with him, he trained him and kicked me to get me to approach not from the king. But the king was very nice, the barretrait has become very nice. That's not a brilliant page for retirement. It has much less shine for the body. Is that the only sport you watch on TV, tennis? Oh no, I love her football, me. What do I like football? Yes, I believe it's all football and tennis. And you played tennis? Yes a lot. More than at war, I am a victim of war. Oh yeah. And what does it change in your body when you practice tennis, when you practice more afterwards? There are things. I don't know, no. Finally, for me, not so much, I didn't make it my job. I was 14, 39, it was... I'm 14, I quit tennis at 14. We get you a drape. You well, I'm not? Ah, I was playing well for 14 years, I was just doing that. So, I was playing well, yes. You were ranking. Oh no, 14 years old. So, for small, then it had no development at all. It has tennis today. And to tackle other sports, French boxing, I believe. Oh no, he does a little boxing, but I was hurt, I stopped right away. Yes yes. Yes, I did a little boxing, yes. And you think tennis has changed a lot since you were young? Well, that raises all sports. The sports there too, it is the media of variation. So, we find them problems of style. Oh, it's very interesting sport because it's the question of the attitudes of the body. There is a variation of the attitudes of the body which are on spaces, long spaces, more or less not. For example, it's obvious that we don't jump the haides in the same way. Now 50 years ago. I say... And the variables should be classified in the story of hope. Because there are tactical variables in football, tactics have changed tremendously. On my childhood, there are body postures attitude variables. There are long pond variables. But I crossed over at one point, I was interested in the shot put to do it myself. But because the weight thrower templates have evolved at some point earlier. Tanto, it was about power. But how, with very powerful launchers, to recover speed, sometimes fast templates. But how by putting speed as the first element to recover power? That's very interesting. It's almost the word sociologist, it's going to launch all sorts of studies on body attitudes in civilizations. But sport, what an area of variation in attitudes, quite formamental. So, in Th\xe9disme, even before the war, where I remember the champions before the war, it is obvious. The attitudes were not the same, not at all. And then, what interests me a lot, so we come a little to the problems of style, it is the champions who are really creative. There are two kinds of great champions that don't have the same value for me. Creators and poker players. The poker players are what bring an already existing, powerless, unequaled style. I would say, for example, endol is not fundamentally creative. And then, in Thedism, the great creators, that is to say, even at the level to speak quite simply, who invent new moves, who introduce new tactics. And on that, without a waffle, everything comes out as a follower. But great designers are inventors. It's true in terms of sports altogether. So, I tell myself that there was the great turning point of Thedism. It is a proletarization, proletarization, all relative. I mean, it's become a mass sport. Massive rather, I therefore do not prolobe, but in fact, let's take a plunge into the proletarianization of Thedism. However, of course, there were deep movements to explain that this is done. But it wouldn't be done if there hadn't been a genie at the same time. It was edge that ensured. Why not here, bring the style of mass int\xe9nice. He had to create him from start to finish. Then it's swallowed up by very good champions, but not creators of the Vila type, etc. But edge, it suits me very well. It helps you from Christ, and he had a space of Christic air, this extremity, this tee shot, that he was respected by all the players, etc. Did you say on camera? You said on camera, I attended. Ah yes, I witnessed a lot of things, we tell you, yes. But I said to myself on edge there, edge, it is therefore a Christic character. He has on mass sport, he creates mass tennis. And all that implies the total invention of a new game. we always find the law. I am you, you are congratulating me, I am healthy instead of what I did to you. Because on board him, he changes. He changes when he has secured his shot, it interests him more. It evolves the edge style to evolve, evolve. As long as the tasks have remained a bit in the same thing. So you have to say the antiboard, you liked gold. It was what ? What... What is the Trolot style that imposed it? The past ? At the bottom of the course, the absolute collection and the lifting. And the top of the net. Anything for the other, we can understand that. We any small frame, we can understand this game there. I'm not saying he can. It's interesting. The very principle. Bottom line, facelift, bottom up, is the opposite of istocratic principles. These are the popular principles. Simply that she gets in the way, you shouldn't... Borgue, it's exactly like the Jesus, like the Lotheliste. He is an aristocrat who goes to the people. It's finally I have stupidity. And well, it was an astonishing blow, astonishing the blow Borgue. Very very curious, a great creator, in sport. And there was my cane who was a pure aristocrat to him. A kind of aristocrat, half Gypsian, half Russian, service, who invented his tricks for him. So he knew no one could follow him. She's the aristocrat who doesn't want to be followed. While he did invent prodigious shots, in particular, he invented a shot which consists of putting the ball down. Very curious, he has no pose. He did a stolen serve combo. Who wasn't? It was well known. The stolen service sequence. But that of Borgue de Bacquette Roue, absolutely. All that, we could talk about Chagat. Another great, then, but not of the same importance, I believe. He's the other American, I don't know his name anymore. Connors. Connors, who, then, we can clearly see the aristocratic principle of the flat ball. The refusal of the infinite, the flat ball, and skimming the net. That is a very, very curious aristocratic principle. And strike out of balance. Never, never, never, never, does he have so many genes when he's completely unbalanced. It is curious coexamination. There is a story of hope. It should be said that it does not all sports. Their evolution, the creators, the followers. Those exactly like in the bows. There are creators, there are followers. There are changes, there are developments. There is the story. There is a becoming. You started a sentence with &quot;I attended&quot;. That's one more detail. I believe I attended. It's not hard to assign the origin of a move. I remembered before the war, there were the Australians. Here too, there are questions of nation. For what ? Why did the Aussies who were backhanding the backhand? At the start of the two-handed backhand, there were the Aussies doing it. In my memory, I believe. In any case, it is an Australian invention. For what ? The Australians, the relationship between the two-handed backhand, the Australians, it's not obvious. I don't know, maybe there's a reason. But I remember a blow that hit me at the end. Because it had no effect. You could see that the other was missing it, that the elimit was missing it. But we thought to ourselves why it had been a rather soft blow. Then we think about it well. We realized that was their place. When the opponent served, then the player returned the serve. And returned a rather soft blow, but which had the property of falling exactly on the end of the feet. From the server that was rising on the fly. And who served them, not even in mivoli, who couldn't take them. It was a funny thing because we said to ourselves, what is that? We didn't really understand why it was a hit here, gargnancy. And in my opinion, the first to have, in any case, systematized that. He was a very great Australian player who didn't have a great career on curves, on rebattu. It didn't interest anyone who was called Bromwich, which must have been just before the war or just after the war, I don't even remember. And who was a very, very great player and he also had an inventory of blows. And that, I remember, in hunger, in hunger for young men, my scoulat astonishment which has now become classic, that all are but here it is, only with a sudden invention, to my knowledge, the generation of withdrawal , all that was not, when she does not try to scoulat in tennis. It has me to give back. Well, finish and at all, it's my caneure, you think when he insulted the referee. And in fact, he insults himself much more than he insults the referee. It is a matter of style which is not content with its expression. No, it's a style thing because it's part of his style. It's nervous research, it's... Yes, that. Just as a speaker can get angry and there are speakers who have very icy, finally it is fully part of style. So he likes it, that's the gun, that's how it looks in German.

Mon. Yes, one. A. Yes. Philosophy, science, cut off from the universal. However, you always say that philosophy must remain in contact with singularities. Is there a paradox? Ah, there is no paradox because philosophy, and even science, fruition, has nothing to do with the universal. They are ready-made ideas, they are ideas of opinion. The opinion on philosophy is that it deals with universes at... The opinion on science is that it deals with universal phenomena which can always be repeated, etc. But even if you take a formula like all the cords, if it leaves, what is important is because all the cords, if it is important, it is the fall and the singularities of the fall. That scientific singularities, for example mathematical singularities in functions, or physical singularities, or chemical singularities, freezing fists, etc. be reproducible. We go further and then afterwards, these are secondary phenomena, these are processes of universalization. But what science deals with is not universals, it's singularities. Freezing handles, when a body changes the state, by the litalicate, of a litasolide, etc. A philosophy, which is not of one, of being at all that, is nonsense. She deals with singularity too. One would almost have to say that in fact one always saves oneself in multiplicities. Multiplicities are sets of singularity. The formula of multiplicity or of a set of singularities is ennou reason. That is to say, the 1 is always what must be straired. So the philosophy, I believe that there are two mistakes not to make. Philosophy is not concerned with universals. There are three kinds of universals. To make a report, yes, three kinds of universals, if you will. There are universals of contemplation, ideas with a growth, there are universals of reflection. There are universals of communication. It is the last refuge of the philosophy of universals. In Bermassie, the Mesa, the universals of communication. That implies, we define a philosophy either as contemplation, or as reflection, or as communication. In all three cases, it's comical. It's frankly bullshit. The philosophy that contemplates okay, it makes everyone laugh, the philosophy that is thoughtful, it makes a bet but it's even dumber because we talk. No one needs a philosophy to think about. Like math, they don't need a philosophy to think about math. An artist, he doesn't need to seek a philosophy to think about painting or music. Boulez, he doesn't need to go see a philosophy to think about music. That is to say, philosophy is a reflection on, it's my grips and everything. That's my catch and philosophy. And what he is supposed to reflect on, that there is no need for philosophy to reflect. When you have communication, I don't talk about it, that's... Philosophy is about establishing a consensus in communication. From the world of communication, that's the happiest idea we've heard since. Then, philosophy is lustric to have nothing to do with communication. What doesn't have to do with seeing communication, sugar is fine herself. It is to do with opinion and consensus of opinion, it is the art of questioning, in short. Philosophy has nothing to do. Philosophy once again, we say of opinion at the beginning, it consists in creating concepts. It's not communicated. Art is not communicative. Art is not reflexive. Art is not nelation. It is neither contemplative, nor reflexive, nor communicative. He's creative, that's all. So the formula is minus one removed unity. It is always a suppressed universal.\",\"topics\":[\"one\",\"unity\",\"multiplicity\",\"difference\",\"body\",\"concept\",\"philosophy\"],\"length\":3605,\"wordCount\":585},{\"letter\":\"V\",\"title\":\"Voyage\",\"filename\":\"L'Abe\u0301ce\u0301daire de GILLES DELEUZE - V comme Voyage  (HD).m4a.txt\",\"audioFilename\":\"Voyage.mp3\",\"content\":\"So exit the universals, it has nothing to do with philosophy? Yes, no, it has nothing to do. Not his directly had and seen, that's travels. And that is the demonstration that a concept becomes unparadox. Because you invented a notion, a concept, we can say that he named hymisms. And you are the journeys. We can make this revelation at that time, we maintain, you are the trips. Why are you having the trips? I don't have the travels, the conditions for a poor intellectual to travel. Maybe if I will travel otherwise, I loved travel. But I am the other intellectuals. What it means to travel, it means to go to a conference at the other end of the Hu-Duman, if need be. And with all that entails before and after, by the befores with people who welcome you kindly, by the afters with people who have listened to you kindly, by talking, talking, talking. So it's the opposite of travel, intellectual travel. Go to the good wind of to talk about what to do at home, and to have people before to talk and see people after to talk. It's a monstrous journey. So that said, it's true that I have no sympathy for travel. But it's not a principle, I don't pretend to be right about the thank you. But for me, if you want, I'll say what's in the journey. On the one hand, it always has a small side of false structures. That, I would say, is the first aspect. What kind of me is for me, only for me. What makes travel antipathetic to me? First reason is that it's a cheap break. And I totally feel what he said general. This is not a trip to make a real break. If you want engroup, do something else. Finally, what do we see? People who travel, they travel a lot. Afterwards, they have her even proud, they say it's to find a father. There are great reporters who write books about it. They have done everything, they have made the life of the soul. The Afghan, in all that one wants, he says to the brake of me. They passed these to be the archer of the device. It's for help. The trip is approached at a very short distance. So well, well, I say to myself, no, it's not okay. The second reason, it seems to me that there is a... So very touched by an admirable phrase, as always from baquettes, which makes one of these characters say more or less, I'm quoting badly, it's better said than that. It's... We're stupid all the same, but not to the point of traveling for pleasure. So, at this moment, this sentence does not seem perfectly satisfactory to me. Me, I'm stupid, but not to the point of traveling for pleasure, it's still not. Ah good. Then, on the third aspect of the trip, I mean, so you said, normal, yes. I've always been fascinated by names, but that's previously because names are people who don't travel. What travel are the emigrants. There may be extremely respectable people, who are forced, traveled. Emigrants, that, that, is a field of travel, then. So there is no question of missing each other, because these are sacred journeys. It's forced trips, it's trips. Okay, that... All right. But the names, there is a journey not, what. The names, therefore, contrary to the letter, he remained mobile. That is to say, all the name specialists, they say, it's because they don't want to leave. It's not if it spits on the ground, because they cling to their ground. The orcterus becomes deserted and so clings, they can only nommadis and in their land. It is strong to want to stay on their land, which they name. So, in a sense, one could say, nothing is more immobile than a nomad. Nothing travels less than a nomad. It's not if they don't want to leave that they're nommad. So, that's why they're absolutely so undercut. And then, finally, afterwards, it's the last aspect of the trip, which isn't very... There, I found it, there is a phrase of prowess, very beautiful, finally, what is it? what do we do when we travel? We always check something, what. We check that the color we dreamed of is indeed there. To which he adds, it is very important. He says, a bad alarm clock, and someone who won't see if the color he dreamed of is really there. But a good alarm clock, you have to go check it out. See if the color is there, is there. So, that, I say to myself, that's a good conception of travel. But also no... It's a fantastic variation. No, at the same time, there are trips. There are trips that are real ruptures. For example, the life of the oclesio currently seems to be something where there is certainly a break. Lorenz. Lorenz. Lorenz, it's... Yes, Lorenz, yes, that, I... There are too many great writers for whom I have put against admiration, and who have a sense of travel Stevenson, I tell you travel , I tell you, Stevenson. It's not nothing, all that. So, if I say there, no generalization. I say, for my own account, someone who doesn't like travelling, it must be for these four reasons. The field of travel is linked to your natural slowness. No, Mr Council very long journeys. Yes, in any case, I don't need to eat. Me, all the intensities that I have are immobile intensities. Intensities are distributed either in space, or else in other systems, not necessarily in exterior space. Me, I assured you that when I read a book that I admire that I find beautiful, or when I hear music that I find beautiful, really, then I have the feeling of going through such states that never has a trip to Paris given me emotion. So why would I go looking for those emotions that don't suit me very well, when I have them for me more beautiful in immobile systems, like music or like philosophy. There is a geomusic, a geophilosophy, it's deep countries. It's more my countries, yes. foreign land. These are my lands foreign to me. So I don't find them in travel, no. We made allowance for the illustration that the movement is not about moving, but you still traveled a little bit, you were in Lebanon, since you gave conferences in Canada or the USA. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I do that, but I mean I was always doing it, now I don't anymore because I have... But I never should have done all that. I overdid it. Then, I walked to myself there. Now I can walk less well. It doesn't even matter anymore. I even walked well. Yes, I remember, I was on foot, me, from morning to evening, without knowing where I was going.

Ah well, that's a whirlwind. So it's not the Z of Zorro just here, as we understood through this alphabet, not judgment, but it's the Z of bisurcation, of lightning. It is he who has in the name of the great philosophers. Z\xe9ne, Zara, Tustra, Leibniz, Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergzone, obviously from Euse. Ah, that's very spiritual. Spirituals with Bergzone is very nice for me. Z\xe9ne, well yes it's informal, and then it makes us join. Ah the fly, the Zen of the fly, the Zen of the fly, the Zen of the fly, it is the Zen of the fly. It's the last word. There is no word after Zena. Good to end on this. So what is actually going on in the Zene? Z\xe9ne is the opposite of the nose which also extended Z\xe9ne to it. It's the movement, the fly, what is that, that? Perhaps it is the elementary movement. It is perhaps the movement which presided over the creation of the world. You feel bad about it, I take care of it like everyone else. I see that it takes pretty hot on the Big Bang, the creation of the universe. The curvy girl says it all, how it happened at the Big Bang. It is necessary to say at the origin of things, there is not the Big Bang, there is another. THANKS. So the Z\xe9ne de la mouche, the Big Bang, the hidden mission. It should be replaced by the Z\xe9ne which is indeed, which is the Z\xe9ne, which is the course of the fly. It means to believe. For me, it's still a bit that the Z\xe9xac is what we were saying earlier about not universals but sets of singularity. The question is how to relate disparate singularities, to relate or potentials. If we speak as in terms of physics, we can imagine a chaos, a potential, how to relate potentials. So I no longer know in which vaguely scientific discipline, we have a term that appealed to me so much that I took advantage of it in a book. They explained that between two potentials, this passed to Phenomenon, and that they did not define the idea of a dark precursor. The dark precursor is so much about connecting different potentials. And once there was the path of the dark precursor, the two potentials were like in a state of reaction there and between the two, flashed the visible event, the clear ones. There was the dark precursor and then the clear ones. That's how the world goes. There is always a dark precursor that no one sees, and then the clear ones that eliminate, and that's the world. You, that should be the thought, that must be Sophie's daughter. That's the big Z. And that's also the wisdom of Z\xe9ne. The sages are the dark precursor and then the stroke of the baton, since the master of Z\xe9ne spends his time discussing the stroke of the baton. The stroke of the stick is the lights that make things visible. And so, we are done. I'm glad to have a Zen in your name. Delighted. So. What a good hour, the end. Oh, here it is.
